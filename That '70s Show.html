                <div class="text show-more__control">I grew up watching That 70's show on nickelodeon and recently started watching the series again and I fell in love with the show again. The actors were incredible, the show was creative and the writing was amazing. This started to change from around series 4-5.<br><br>What I first loved about the show is that it wasn't the typical American comedy. There was a strong love story, but unlike many other comedies, the love story between Eric and Donna felt so real and you could relate to their relationship so easily. They were unbelievably convincing and you could feel the love between them both. <br><br>However this series did start to turn for the worse. There were cheap jokes and poor story lines. I think the writers were starting to run out of ideas, which does happen. I just wish the show had the beautiful ending it deserved, leaving us wanting more. Ricky Gervais made just two seasons of the UK office for this reason exactly. He didn't want it to lose it's touch and what it was about. In my opinion The UK version of the office has had the best ending of any comedy series in the Christmas specials. <br><br>I wish That 70's show ended in a similar way (and it had a very good chance) with Eric and Donna getting married. Throughout the whole first 4 series Red had always been so harsh on Eric, playing the hard dad and when he finally came round the the idea of letting them get married I thought this was the perfect way to end. Eric and Donna happy, their friends happy for them and Eric also winning round his dad for the first time. <br><br>I loved the moment in that last episode of season 7 between Red and Eric where the two of them hug for the first time. It had the same emotional feel that a lot of the earlier seasons had. Season 8 however...I won't go into season 8. I read another review and I would like to mirror one of the points made that the show is about Eric, Eric's first love, Eric's parents and Eric's friends so the fact that they made a series without Eric is quite hard to believe and it feels like a sham. Just some more money for the producers. <br><br>I didn't mind the love story between Hyde and Jackie as it showed character development (mostly on Hyde's side) and also went quite deep into his character which I loved. He is another character you wanted things to go well for as he didn't have the best of upbringings. <br><br>This review may sound critical but that's only because I feel let down by the creators of the show.The earlier seasons were unbelievable however and the show still remains one of my favourites. I'm sure like everyone else, I fell in love with the love story between Eric and Donna but I just wish it ended earlier with that happy ending we deserved.</div>

This series is really funny, really different, and has an amazing cast.<br><br>In my opinion, this is one of the best casts assembled in a long time. Everybody makes me laugh (especially Eric and Fez).  All of the characters are likable and each actor puts in that little something each week that is needed to make a television series survive.  Topher Grace is really great and I still can't believe that he didn't have any acting experience prior to this show.  That's one of the best things about this show - all of the actors really had no acting gigs and just fell into the roles immediately.<br><br>The writers are extremely funny.  Although the writing is simple at times, it's unpredictable the next, and that's what I like.  Each episode has good scenarios/plots and always makes me laugh.<br><br>Everything about it is good and it's not the same as all of the other shows that are currently on TV.  It stands out with an excellent cast (and an excellent theme song.  That thing gets stuck in my head so easily.)  I like the seventies, I like this show, but was "That '80s Show" really necessary?</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart. Not too say, the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon ( Don Starks and tommy Chong are great too) left the show it would have the same affect. And the inclusion of Randy ( Josh Meyers) didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans. I believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent. I am going to miss the show, i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as That 80's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I guess that one might say that "That '70s Show" is to the 1990s what "Happy Days" was to the 1970s: a look at how cool things were twenty years earlier in Wisconsin. And they do a great job with it. The characters are: Eric Foreman (Topher Grace), a sometimes clueless high school student; Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon), Eric's strong-willed friend; Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), a complete imbecile; Jackie Burkhart (Mila Kunis), the vain, egotistical member of the group; Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson), the cynical member of the group; Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), a foreign exchange student who always tries to be cool; Red (Kurtwood Smith), Eric's hard-ass father; and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), Eric's jolly mother.<br><br>Tommy Chong occasionally appears as Hyde's stoner boss Leo. Throughout the series, the circle of friends comes across all sorts of situations, which usually end up accentuating Kelso's stupidity or Hyde's distrust of authority. Oftentimes, they assess everything through popular culture (namely disco or any TV show that had existed up to that point). But no matter what happens, it's always safe to assume that Red will threaten to kick someone in the ass, or at least call someone a dumb-ass.<br><br>Either way, it's a great show. You gotta see it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Over the years, we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping "8 Simple Rules" going after John Ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared. The idea of having "That 70's Show" without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore. It just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny. The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere, and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasn't Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that he'd do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching "As The World Turns". I'm guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from "Family Matters". To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.<br><br>By the way, yet more criticism on Season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme? Not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), Fez scared the hell out of me. Dude, don't open your eyes that far. But the first five seasons or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Unlike the 70s sitcom it sometimes mocks (Happy Days), this show has no peaks and valleys, and never "jumped the shark". It's just a rock solid, funny show and has been for the duration of its run (so far). I have watched just about every episode since the beginning, and have never been let down. It's an extremely underrated show which could reach ledgendary status if it runs for a few more years. Everyone in the cast is very funny and endearing in their own way. The best thing is that they never stray from the original characterizations. And you never doubt for a minute that you're back in the seventies, unlike Happy Days, which was set in the 50s yet much of the cast (Scott Baio anyone?) sported contemporary haircuts. This show is a gem. Watch. You won't be disappointed.</div>

<a href="/review/rw1849851/?ref_=tt_urv" class="title"> A day at Point Place, Wisconsin... the one to live over and over. With laughs.

                    <span class="display-name-link"><a href="/user/ur7685652/?ref_=tt_urv">SaniOKh</a></span><span class="review-date">31 March 2008</span>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">How does an usual day start in Point Place, Wisconsin...<br><br>First of all, Red, the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a WWII veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son, Eric, he sits at the table as well, and his father starts his daily yelling, usually involving placing his foot in Eric's behind if (insert reason here). If his promiscuous angel-faced sister Laurie is at home, she comes along, then Red stops yelling and kindly talks to her, making Eric feel left out of the family.<br><br>Once this daily (painful) ritual is over, Eric rushes down to his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out. And when we get to see them, it becomes obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next-door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the sanest people around. Meet Steven Hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's around as long as it's not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees; Jackie Burkhardt, the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid of a rich father, and, of course, cheerleader; and Fez, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep a secret. At first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun of Kelso, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.<br><br>Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donna's weirdo parents, Bob and Midge. He's rude, but they don't mind, as they think he's joking. Somewhere around is Leo, an aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.<br><br>Did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? Of course, most seem "clichéd", but the show takes the cliché to a new level. Now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer, sit down and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever. The one that never does two times the same thing and which is, compared to most sitcoms that are "cute funny", purely hysterical. If you get hooked, don't let this show let you go. Bite on the hook over and over and, man, you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This show has come so far. At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished. They stuck with the show and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go down swinging, get one last punch in. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on Friends, and let the finale be huge. I say get Donna and Eric married, I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him. JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!<br><br>That 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best!<br><br>10/10...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This show is one of my favorites.  I just started watching it last week when Fox aired an episode every night of the week.  I cannot believe I've been missing this show!  It's one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time.  Tho, I'm no fan of the 70's as a decade, the show makes me wanna go back and live it all again...wait I was born in 1978, so forget that idea.   Anyhow...the show follows the lives of a group of 17 year- olds in the 70's and everything they do is hilarious.  I love the character of Fez, who happens to be foreign, and he's sorta the dork of the show.  He tries to be cool and catch all the fads of the time, but he never seems to get it right, and he's always after Jackie, played by the beautiful Mila Kunis.  As for Jackie, the relationship between her and her boyfriend is classic.  The guy is a total idiot, and she's almost as dippy as he is...As for Eric, who is the male lead, and Donna- his girlfriend, they are so sweet together...if I do say so myself.  They are the perfect couple on the show, and I'm shocked they're acting, they do the couple thing so well!   The show is like a lot of comedies, but it's got an edge most shows don't. I love the shots where the camera rotates around the table, showing all the guys talking...it's a staple of almost every episode.  Check this show out if you haven't had a chance, or chose to ignore it!!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Has anyone want to talk about Jackie and Hyde relationship? Season 8 really has poor writing. I know it sounds harsh but why they left hanging the Jackie and Hyde situation? They were such a perfect couple. Jackie made Hyde open up and be a better person. Jackie seems to be nicer when she's around him. Why they don't have "the talk" about their relationship after Hyde saw Jackie and Michael together. The last season really sucks because this show changed the writers at the last season. Plus, literally everyone in the last season left.
I really like the other seasons though. Different kind of comedy, great friendships and Red Forman. Seriously never get tired of dumbasses and foot in your ass jokes.</div>

After seven seasons, the show hasn't got boring and that credits must go to the writers. There are some very interesting and funny characters like Red Forman, Fez or regular guest characters like Leo. The actors are quite good, especially Danny Masterson or Wilmer Valderrama (he got a fabulous accent) or Debra Jo Rupp. At first Mila Kunis was really bad but she got better as the show advanced. It is good that the story advanced really well along these seasons. And I like the way they capture the '70s atmosphere, like through the references of the movies or music.<br><br>And the title song rocks.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Loved most of the cast and could relate to most. However the one consistent character/actor I couldn't stand was Donna/Laura Prepon. The combination of her bad acting and forced relationship with Eric annoyed me every episode. She would laugh at every line or would take things a little too seriously. They should've just fired her. Then there's Randy/ Josh Meyers. Ugh. I understand the writers trying to replace Eric's character but this was a bad idea. He was as funny as warm milk. He just goes to the Grooves shop, gets a job, and that's how he's introduced. He then started dating Donna, again another forced relationship. At this point of the show (Season 8), it should've just never existed. After the two main characters left, the studio clearly focused more on profits rather than just ending on a happy note. Eventually Hyde, Fez, Jackie, and Forman's parents were all that kept this show moving on to the bitter end. By Season 8, the main characters were either moving out , getting married, getting jobs, in other words, they grew up. The story went from kids growing up in the 70's to average middle class adults in the 70's. Once again, was great in the beginning, but once the two top characters left, they should've just cashed out.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Along with reruns of "Seinfeld", of course, and maybe some "Friends" reruns.<br><br>We all know the plot by now: life in the 70s. My mom says that some of the characters actually remind her of people she knew when she was in high school then.<br><br>Lots of great pokes at the decade here, from disco to streaking to Star Wars to Charlie's Angels (and yet no jokes about TV's "M*A*S*H"), and all the usual coming of age jokes (men VS women). The beautiful red haired, deep voiced, 5-foot-10-inch Laura Prepon, who plays Donna (and was also the main reason I started watching this show), is probably the most normal character on the show (the only time she ever really got colorfully bent out of shape about something was when she found another woman's underwear in Eric's car, which is understandable for any woman, only to find out that her mom and dad were back there one night) with Topher Grace's Eric in second place. Danny Masterson is great as the dead pan conspiracy theorist Hyde. I don't see what's so great about Ashton Kutcher, but I will give him credit for giving his all in the role of the male bimbo, same to Mila Kunis (who's finally making the transition from simply cute to actually being beautiful) as the self-absorbed Jackie and Wilmer Valderamma (or however you spell his name) as Fez. However, this show has ruined my ability to enjoy the 1987 hit "Robocop" because I've come to enjoy Kurtwood Smith so much in the role of Eric's cranky dad Red Foreman that I can't stand to see him as the evil Clarence Boddicker who helps mutilate Peter Weller's Murphy in "Robocop". It's a shame they had to replace Lisa Robin Kelly as Lori, even though the new actress Christina Moore is prettier.<br><br>I will say this though: the show has now exhausted and run all good ideas, and yet it's still more endearing than TV's "M*A*S*H". Here's the rule for watching the reruns: if Donna's mom Midge (former Bond girl Tanya Roberts, who rallied a few other former Bond girls together for an episode) is there, you're good. However, if Eric and Donna have broken up, change the channel immediately (it's just not right, those two not being together) or if Donna is sporting blonde hair, or if Eric and Kelso just aren't there at all, also change the channel. The fifth season shows where Jackie starts dating Hyde are pretty much reliable. But all in all, it's a great watch, certainly a lot better than current "Friends" and "The Simpsons".</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">As the title suggests, this comedy takes place in the 70's (one of my favorite musical decades). It revolves around a group of friends which are all late teenagers and covers all of their daily hassles with friends, parents work and love. There is a variety of different and real characters here, plus the one that no comedy can work without it seems: the incredible dumb-ass. In this series this person is Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Then there is Eric (Topher Grace), whose basement is the place where the main characters usually hang to avoid their parent and Erics sister. Eric is an OK guy, whose girlfriend Donna (Laura Pepron) lives in the same street as he does. The relationship between the two is very well worked out and they behave in a way I think is appropriate for serious couples of that age. The rest of the crew are Jackie (Mila Kunis) who is really self absorbed and not one of the favorite's of the group, although she belongs there. Then of course there's Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) the foreigner, who is thinks very highly of himself at times, but who is also naive and shy in a way. The crew is completed by my favorite character, Hyde (Danny Masterson). The reason I like him so much is that he is very easygoing. Plus he is extremely cool, I mean when he cracks a joke or makes a remark it always strikes a chord, whether it is a wise or a mean statement. Overall this is a good show with some great and some standard comedy characters (of which not all are mentioned here). <br><br>8 out of 10</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">... and the series lets you forget all that. I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.<br><br>The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbishness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric.</div>

Eric left,kelso left and you tried to replace these guys with this blonde dude who haven't been fun at all! Best to stop the show at season 7 and not at season 8. this show was something like friends and now imagine friends ending with 2 base actors not being there! was the worst season i ever seen so i give 8/10 on IMDb but to my friends i say like 6,5-7/10! i suggest to watch this but until season 7! season 8 is really bad! so this is a very good series to watch and i believe you could make a new one with these actors if they are alive at all but please if you make a new one don't ruin it like this one!i really loved the show but season 8 just ruined it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Over the last month or so, I have watched the entire series. The show was well put together with actors that filled their roles very well. The main storyline, the life of teenager Eric Forman, is engaging enough to keep you interested and entertained. I felt that the show stayed true to what life as a teen was like. We all had that first kiss, first time, first heartbreak, our handful of friends we did everything with, our experiences with things like alcohol, drugs, and interest in all things relating to sex. We were all a teenager once. This show takes you on another ride as a teen. <br><br>Where this show hit me was in showing the way times change us as a Country. Over the course of the series you notice that things Americans held close to their heart, such as patriotism and religion opening up to newer concepts such as, interracial couples, open marriage, and homosexuality. If you watch the series, sure you become attached to the characters, that's why you tune in, but at the end of the finale, what I felt wasn't a joy for Fez and Jackie, or hope for Eric and Donna, what I felt was a loss of our way of life. <br><br>We can't have a Kelso, our kids aren't allowed enough freedom to be that adventurous. We can't have an Eric, our kids aren't allowed to be an underachiever in anything. We can't have a Hyde, our kids aren't allowed to be free thinkers. We certainly can't have a Donna, our children are not allowed to stand up and fight for their beliefs. We've turned all of our children into Jackie. They have been taught that they are all special, and perfect, and deserve everything handed to them right when they want it. If a neighbor were to simply pop into our home unannounced today, they'd be met with a bullet, not a friendly hello. Do you even know the neighbors on both sides of you and across the street? After the finale, I thought of my kids, and I felt sad for them. I felt ashamed that they cannot experience a real childhood. I felt the loss this Country has had, but hasn't seemed to notice... I felt the loss of trust in one another. The show is great, and if you pay attention, you see a bit more than the experiences of a 70's teen, you see the end of an era.</div>

I lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before I go to sleep. At the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep. I was so sad they took the show off air... at least we still have the re-runs!! I am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion...Like maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and Eric get married!!!! Wouldn't that be awesome!!! It would be even better if they would continue it for several years!!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I haven't liked many TV shows post 1990, but THAT 70S SHOW is great. Never seeing it during it's first run, thinking a gimmicky period piece, I was wrong! I started watching in reruns and the more I watched, the more I liked! Now, it is the only show premiering post-1990 that I watch regularly.<br><br>Although THAT 70S SHOW mimics some of the styles, attitudes, music, and tastes of the 70s, it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s. It contains so much funny, witty, biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clichés by just being humorous. The humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable.<br><br>Although a hilarious sitcom, no matter what time period, the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity. But its the focus on universal issues (family problems, teen angst, marital issues, peer pressure), dealing with all of them with comic aplomb, that gives the show a mass appeal.<br><br>The show's center is one Eric Forman (played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar Topher Grace). Eric is a super-skinny, geeky-looking, non-athletic teen and still comes off as super-cool due to Grace's brilliant self-deprecation of the character. Eric has 5 friends Donna, Hyde, Kelso, Jackie, and Fez (played respectively in hilarious fashion by Laura Prepon, Danny Masterson, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, and Wilmer Valderama). We get to see life in Point Place, Wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see! Donna, a forward-thinking feminist, is the object of Eric's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show. They become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are NEVER a boring couple. Most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend, which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity. Hyde is Eric's best friend and soon moves in with the Formans when his mother abandons him; Hyde is the mellow, zen, cool one of the group and just sits back, observes, and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb. Kelso is the dumb one of the group and Kutcher plays it the absolute hilt, displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever! Jackie, who starts out as Kelso's girlfriend, is a verbose, self-absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b/c of Kelso, but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all HAVE to accept her! And finally, Fez! Fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country (we never know exactly where) and he is a scene-stealer! "I said good day!" "You son of a b*tch!" Valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters I have ever seen. His scene-stealing moments often help make the show for me.<br><br>The show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be. The gang repeatedly gets into trouble (most of it on purpose). They constantly play gags on the Point Place residents as well as each other. They hang out most of the time in Eric's basement plotting, pontificating, or just plain playing around.<br><br>Also figuring prominently in the show are Eric's parents, the menacing, commie-hating Red and the lovable, happy-go-lucky Kitty (played memorably by Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp). These 2 adults give the show a much-needed mature point-of-view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do-wells. Red and Kitty are ably supported by Donna's parents, the buffoonish Bob (played wonderfully for the full run by Don Stark) and blonde bimbo daft Midge (the super-sexy Tanya Roberts, who was on the show for about half it's run). Additionally, for 3 full seasons, Eric's sister from hell Laurie (played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy Farrah-Fawcett lookalike Lisa Robin Kelly) was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in Eric and her parents' sides! Kelly came back as a guest character for a few Season 5 eps. But, unfortunately, Kelly's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in Season 6. The newbie didn't last, thankfully, and was gone after a few Season 6 eps!<br><br>Sadly, at the end of Season 7, Topher Grace (Eric) and early in Season 8, Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) left the show and it never recovered as Season 8 turned out to be it's last. Grace and Kutcher returned for the series finale, though, giving the show a satisfying end. <br><br>A lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor. Top notch supporting players were eternally high Leo (played to the hilt by Tommy Chong), Pastor Dave, Roy (the terrific comic Jim Gaffigan), Big Rhonda, Mitch, Earl, etc. They also got legends Marion Ross (HAPPY DAYS) and Betty White (THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW) to play Red and Kitty's mothers, respectively. Many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well, from Shirley Jones (PARTRIDGE FAMILY) to Pamela Sue Martin (NANCY DREW) to Charo to Ted Nugent to K.I.S.S! It goes on and on!<br><br>With great nostalgic 70s homages and references, hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical, take-no-prisoners style of comedic storytelling, THAT 70S SHOW is a television classic!</div>

AND ERIC DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE!!!! You know the show has really start to go downhill since Eric and Kelso left. I don't even know why Kelso left! These two people are the main reason why ANYONE watched this show in the first place. If they get rid of Fez now they can cancel the show and be done with it ( I mean who wants to watch Red,Kitty,Donna,Jackie,Bob,Hyde,and his STRIPPER WIFE?) And they never go anywhere or do anything. They just hang out in the basement. Oh joy. Maybe they should change it to ''That Basement Show'' Some decades never die. Sadly it's time for this one to go.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I had always used "Friends" and "The Cosby Show" as my measuring stick for bottom-of-the-barrel sitcom-making. However, having survived several excruciatingly bad scenes of "The 70s Show", I might want to reconsider which sitcom it is that truly earns its rightful place at the throne located in the densely-populated lowest levels of the mountain-cave of TV drivel.<br><br>First of all, when you cast a sitcom with rank amateurs who haven't got the slightest acting talent or experience in comedy, then it doesn't even matter that the scripts are just as bad. You can't make a cake out of bird-droppings. (Well, you can, but it will only be eaten by easy-to-please, hungry, bird-brained viewers...) Ashton Kutcher, a former catwalk zombie, makes Claudia Schiffer ("Blackout") look like a stage legend by comparison. The grinning moron behind MTV's idiotically-named "Punk'd" and the producing "genius" behind "The Butterfly Effect" (one of the silliest movies of this decade) mugs his geeky self through this awful TV show as if he were on drugs or suffering from hyper-activity (an affliction often found in the less-than-bright children). Shouting, grinning, jumping like a banshee, and making exaggerated childish faces may work for the French, but the rest of us want something more than that. After all, any idiot can act like that. It's about as funny as David Schwimmer slipping on a banana peel. (Unless this was shown on a paparazzi programme, then it'd be funny...)<br><br>Similar situation with Wilmer Valderrama. His role is that of a goofy moron with a "cute" accent/voice that we're supposed to find utterly and belly-achingly funny. Both Vilmer's character and his talentless self would have been rejected for any "Police Academy" sequel. But in the abysmal world of 90s/00s sitcoms, he is a star.<br><br>It was almost frightening to see the astoundingly high IMDb rating plus the fact that this crap survived into its 8th or 9th season! (I felt a shudder not unlike that when I was watching "Eraserhead".) Fans of this show, are we even from the same planet? <br><br>The rest of the cast is nearly as hopeless, including the supremely talent-free and uncharismatic Danny Masterson - another former-model-turned-shoddy-sitcom-actor. (I know, he's a midget; he modeled as a 4 year-old, though. That's when they actually need low heights...) True, the rest don't degrade themselves quite as badly as Demi's lapdog or the nerdy Latino sidekick, but just being part of these immensely lame scripts makes them all look rather pitiful. Sure, they're all laughing on the way to their respective banks, but deep down inside they must feel at least a tinge of embarrassment about being involved in this horrendous crap of a show.<br><br>This is lowest-common-denominator humour, quite literally a laugh-fest for the low-IQ masses.<br><br>Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and check out my "TV &amp; Cinema: 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism" list.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Not since The Simpsons made it's debut has there been a sitcom that I didn't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes. It has of course been said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this one though.<br><br>The first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became. They even went to school sometimes. The following seasons the character where fledged out. Eric, the sarcastic twit, Donna, his levelheaded girlfriend, Kelso, the dim bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie, the spoiled rich floozy. As for the adult characters there was Eric's mom, the "can you believe she is so ditzy" suburban mom, Eric's dad, the straight arrow who of course wasn't such a hard ass as he seemed, Donna's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom. Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.<br><br>Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. It's a tough character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the Kelso character, played competently by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.<br><br>Hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.<br><br>Jackie, played by Family Guy voice artist Mila Kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice, which actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and Eric because they were f...... hilarious together. Too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with Eric and Donna.<br><br>Last I will say that the casting of guest actors were always great. A few favorites: Fez' humongous girlfriend in the mid-seasons, Pastor Dan, the totally awesome Leo played by the equally awesome Thomas Chong, another one of Fez' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.<br><br>Coming up next on Fox, whatever.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">All the men are idiots; all the women are leaders. I suppose that's the joke?<br><br>-----------------<br><br>The so-called "men":<br><br>"Eric Forman" puts a new low on the castrati of TV-males. If it wasn't for the giant chick correcting him, informing him, or just plane bossing him around, then he'd have no point for living.<br><br>"Kelso" is beyond stupid, and he *needs* his girlfriend "Jackie" to also correct him, inform him, and boss him around.<br><br>"Fez" has no female to push him around and so he's always made to be seen as the biggest looser in the chorus of the TV "males."<br><br>"Hyde" is so messed up that without the kindness of women he'd might as well be dead!<br><br>"Red" is just a big mouth who needs his wife "Kittie" to tell him how to properly react to their "son's" misadventures.<br><br>"Bob" is a nitwit.<br><br>"Leo" is a side character that is nearly as stupid as "Kelso" because of all the dope he's been smoking for 30 years.<br><br>The women:<br><br>"Donna," the giant chick, is the queen of the group. She is smart intelligent, clever, "properly" dishonest (God help us, our moral and ethical decay continues), emotionally stable, personally a rock, has all the right-stuff, etc. etc.<br><br>"Jackie," while utterly superficial has all the talent that "Donna" is missing and still manages to be more dominant than any of the males.<br><br>"Kitty," while deceptively demur, bosses her loud barking husband, "Red," with all the skill of the best passive aggressive manipulator.<br><br>"Midge," while the "dumbest" of the caste (dumber than "Kelso"?) and no longer on the show (naturally) was still her husband's ("Bob" the dimwit) clear superior.<br><br>"Laurie" is the daughter of "Red" and "Kitty" - she puts a new low on the meaning of "tramp." However, being a woman she can manipulate "Red" so easily that burning the house down and saying "Daddy" would all be "ok" with "Red."<br><br>-----------------<br><br>That's it. Five women push seven men around for a half-hour. The laugh track adds to the banality of the show. All in all this is what passes for comedy in America today (2002). All that being said it is a very funny show. After all it is only a comedy, but with a "preaching" subliminal message - without women men would be lost... oh, I get it, HAHahahahaHAHA. :/<br><br>However, in so far as the casting and the actors themselves, they are all ***very*** gifted. Without that this show would be as popular as "That 80's Show" - which disappeared almost as soon as it aired.<br><br>So the major source of social malfeasance is the "Eric Forman" character, that if he was any more "whipped" he would have to push his manhood back inside his body. This character alone, coupled with the giant chick's attitude, will make me stop watching the show.<br><br>In my opinion, this show (particularly "Eric" and "Donna's" relation) is "political correctness" at its most subtle. But this is the thrust of the whole show and belies the general attitude today: women are superior - in ***every*** way - to men.<br><br>Meanwhile on "The Man Show" (it's a cable program) women are treated as mere objects, and men act as the snorting pigs they are reputed to be.<br><br>In the slide downhill toward depravity, Fox is leading the parade. HBO (at night) is a close second. But it must be said that if people didn't watch, people wouldn't be portrayed this way.<br><br>Thank you God for the Discovery channels!<br><br><ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul></div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">When I started watching the show I did not have high expectations. I was not expecting it to top any Sitcom. I remember enjoying season one but I did not get attached to any character except for perhaps Red and Kitty. Seasons two and three were relatively better than the first season. But as I continued watching further, the plot kept repeating itself especially when it comes to the love life of the characters. Seasons seven and eight is the time that the show hit a rock-bottom to me especially season eight. The TV show goes through many changes. The only constant element to the show are Eric's parents Red and Kitty which are genuinely funny. Would I recommend this show? It depends on the person I'm recommending it to. If someone actually lived during the 70s and feels nostalgic they can check this show.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The first 6 or so seasons were pretty fun. Nothing remarkable but quite enjoyable. Character development was slow but it was funny overall and worth the watch with a few exceptions to plot development that could have been interesting but instead ended up keeping things mostly the same. The last two seasons were just awful, especially season 8. References to events in previous seasons were inaccurate, characters changed personalities in order to fill gaps in actors leaving rather then write different stories based on who was left. New people brought in were 1 dimensional and poorly written for, everyone did exactly what you expected them to and they did it badly. The last season especially turned into a standard formulaic sitcom in all the worst ways. Very little made sense, episodes were mostly going after bad one liners and every aspect of the show felt forced and phoned in. Ending it on season 5 or 6 would have made a much better experience overall.</div>

The characters are all great and pretty great acting for a sitcom. Im a sucker for the 70s as well i miss the funky scene transitions of the first season but love all the pop culture references fashion and music they add in it really feels true to the time period. Also its the best show to get baked to by far</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I can't tell you how much joy this TV show has brought me. Besides having amazing characters and capturing the 70s atmosphere, it's just honestly funny. It doesn't just make fun of the situations, in which the characters are, but of life in general and of things that we can all relate to. What I like best is the fact the plot develops and almost no episode is unrelated to the previous ones or is not developed in the next ones. It's like a normal TV series, but funny. Thus, I believe it's so much better than other sitcoms like Friends, where the plot develops in like 4 episodes a season. It's just so cool.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70's Show is one of the best sitcoms to date and it perfectly depicts life in the 70's through a gang of high schoolers and their parents living in the state of Wisconsin. It's really funny and entertaining thanks to the creators, who created this unforgettable sitcom with references to historical events and 70's pop culture, in addition to paying attention to other details such as the clothes, furniture and cars from that era. Despite Eric's departure, Red, Kitty and Donna managed to carry the show and they're my favorite characters while Jackie is by far the worst. Today's sitcoms are not as funny as That 70's Show.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Okay first off, I love this show! It gives me such good vibes and a sense of nostalgia when I watch it. Not to mention some of the jokes even make laugh out loud. The eighth season though... was utterly disappointing and just plain stupid. Nothing matched up. By this time, I was already kind of starting to feel annoyed with most of the characters and the switch up of writers was so obvious. Personally, my favorite character has always been Hyde and I loved the development he had with Jackie. Spoiler, putting Jackie and Fez together in the last 2 episodes was the WORST mistake I've seen in a long time. Totally undeveloped and forced... Not to mention that Donna and Eric just never seemed right as a couple; Randy made it worse. In the end though, even after all the bashing of the show I've been doing, I still do love it and I know it's not supposed to be that deep. I'm just going to imagine season 8 never happened, honestly.</div>

The series began as an 8 or better as the actors embodied their characters and followed a coherent script path that progressed through later teenage years. Seasons 4 &amp; 5 worked as the developments of the 1st 3 seasons were expanded and explored. The quality then began to decline so precipitously that two of the main cast members fled. This was a typical series that stayed on 3 years longer than it should have, but unlike many, was truly magical in the 1st seasons.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp and the actor who plays her on-screen husband being two notable exceptions), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show</div>

Everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch.  They talk in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language.  I've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.<br><br>For another thing, it's NOT FUNNY.  The plots are dull.  They're not creative, intelligent, or FUNNY.  Shouldn't a sitcom be funny??  Why am I not laughing?<br><br>Lastly, what is seventies about this?  It's about as authentic to the seventies as "Happy Days" was to the fifties.<br><br>OH and what is up with Ashton Kutcher?

                <div class="text show-more__control">I just finished watching the entire series of "That '70s Show" and I have to say that this show, in retrospect, isn't very funny, much less worth owning. It's a show better watched episodically and only in the context of where it was originally shown on TV beside other, much better shows, than straight through on its own as it is available now on DVD. While I'm sure that sounds incredibly obvious, I, perhaps wrongly, can't help but compare this show to "Friends," which is very similar albeit a much more successful and funnier sitcom.<br><br>I stuck through watching "That '70s Show" in its entirety to see what the characters would amount to and because I enjoyed Eric and Donna's relationship. Their relationship seemed the one interesting and believable aspect to the entire show and as if it would actually develop and go onto something, moving the show out of the Forman residence. Alas, it seems like due to the producers not knowing how long the show would run for, which cast members would leave, the show as a whole suffers, failing to deliver on any of the relationships or allowing any sort of drama to move the show forward: we're essentially stuck in the Forman's basement for eight years.<br><br>From Season 5 onward we begin to tire of the characters and their limited dynamics, giving rise to a genuine doubt that these characters will make any sort of worthwhile return for us. Everything begins to go downhill from this point onward when we fail to invest in the characters.<br><br>In the midst of the degeneration of the show's plot and its comedy, the show begins to lose direction and flounders with bad writing, awful jokes and pointless episodes that lack so greatly as to make the last couple seasons not worth the time, despite some surprise guest appearances. By the last season, its two funniest and vital characters absent (Eric and Kelso), it's apparent that the show is running on fumes and it finally stalls out completely with a carelessly and poorly construed finale that is both disappointing and abrupt.<br><br>All in all, I feel the show's best moments are in its initial seasons where the personalities and settings are novel and fresh and there seems to be potential. This show lasted for eight seasons due to its great cast and production but could have gone longer and not lost cast members had the writers been more daring and cared more about the characters. Granted, I can see how this show was hard to write as it was primarily about very similar white kids in a remote location with nothing to do, but I guess it's on the creators of the show for setting themselves up for such a challenging premise.<br><br>Nonetheless, the show is what it is.</div>

<a href="/review/rw1317067/?ref_=tt_urv" class="title"> Idiotic show that makes Happy Days look like Shakespeare.

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">What Happy Days was to the 1950's, this show is to the 1970's - a horribly unwatchable travesty that has virtually nothing to do with the decade it purports to reflect. The characters, all played by likable actors individually, simply don't mesh together in a funny way. Some of them would be great given the correct vehicle, but this one is not it. How many times, year after year, can you watch the exact same jokes and same punch lines being delivered, and still think they are funny? Ashton Kutcher shouting "BURN!" or Topher Grace's father saying "dumbass" weren't particularly funny the FIRST time. After 7 or 8 seasons, they are positively obnoxious.<br><br>Whenever I watch this show, I am constantly reminded of the similarities to Happy Days or even Married With Children, which both ran for several seasons long after the jokes and plot lines quit being funny. Plus, having come of age in the 1970's, nothing in That 70's Show reminds me of my youth. I remember the 1970's as being a time of fun and laughter, with interesting and thoughtful people. This show provides none of these.<br><br>Watch a few episodes, just to say you did. Then avoid it like the plague. Basically, if you've seen one episode, you've seen them all. The show appeals to the same mindset as the fictional "Terrance and Philip" show in SOUTH PARK - an obnoxious program that for some reason remains on the air. Watching the people who laugh at it is more entertaining than the show itself.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I've tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s Show," I don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s -- the decade in which I grew up. Of the episodes I have seen, most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period. Take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '70s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny.<br><br>If you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in America in the '70s, in my humble opinion you can do no better than "The Wonder Years."</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">When I first watched this show, I liked it. Unfortunately, The more I watch it now the more it falls apart. The problem isn't the actors, it's the atmosphere. Aside from the clothes, the things in Eric's room, and some other minor references, there's not much about this show that's 70's. All the writers seem to know about the 70's is: There was Disco, There was a gas shortage, and people smoked a lot of pot. Compare this to "The Wonder Years" That show wasn't just a show about the 60's and 70's. That show took you back to that particular time. They didn't just wear the clothes that people wore back then, but there were countless music, video clips, and references of what was going on back then. Even if you compare this show to the movie "Dazed and Confused" it fails. There were cars, music, and moments that all took you back. As far as this show goes, you could set it in any decade and it would be exactly the same. However, this isn't the worse thing about this show. It's the fact that the characters never grow or change. They stay exactly the same for eight years! If you want to be taken back to the 70's Watch "Dazed and Confused" or "The Wonder Years" If you want just a cheesy brainless comedy, watch this show.</div>

However, when Eric left, Donna dyed her hair, Randy came, Michael left, and Jackie bonding with Fez in a certain way, that is when I started to lose hope on this show that transformed from a comedy to a dramatic soap opera that started to lose my interest. Sure, I do not mind the changes in a show. Though, the change in this show felt forced to me as if the writers stopped thinking of clever words, plots, and character evolutions from probably running out of clever ideas after season 6. I could still tolerate season 7, though. But, it felt like this show was only in it to try to compete with its former glory and/or make money from the audience that watched it.</div>

That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)</div>

Then there are shows like Seinfeld, Frasier, King of the Hill, and Friends that make me laugh quite often. Why does everyone think that Ashton Kutcher is FUNNY? I swear, this guy is the most untalented, unintelligent idiot actor in sitcom history. I fail to see the humour in him thinking that Moby Dick is a robot, or him banging his shin of a coffee table. I see him get hurt or say something that is even stupider than anything that comes from Homer Simpson's mouth(he's not funny either), and people around me laugh? Come ON, people, do you have half a brain left in your head? Like I said, Seinfeld, Frasier, King of the Hill, Friends, and even Everybody Loves Raymond are shows that can get a real laugh out and that don't rely on stupidity to make the viewers entertained. I feel that it is shows like this that make it's viewers stupid. Everybody watches this, and they think it's funny and cool to be stupid, so they try to mimick it. I used to be like that. Thank God that I've seen the light. I hope you all will too.</div>

But oh, how the times have changed.  P.C. TV programs have become the norm, which means almost every new show to come out will be pure crap.  The two funniest and well written shows on TV as of right now are cartoons,(Dr. Katz and The Simpsons)which really intrigues me.<br><br>One night, when this show first came out, I was watching it with my mom, and the first thing she said was "This is absolutely not what the seventies were like."  And she's right. This is the 70's portrayed in the 90's way, which, really sucks. I think almost everyone I know loves this show.  And they get angry when I tell them how much I hate it, yet they never listen to my reasons: The jokes are terrible, the fact that the fake audience laugh at EVERYTHING that foreign exchange student says is ridiculous, and every character is unrealistic.  The ONLY thing half-way decent is the father.<br><br>If you want entertainment and brilliant comedy at 8:30 on Sunday night, tune in to Cartoon Network for 'The Tex Avery Show.'</div>

It wasn't. It's written and performed by Hollywood brats who have more control and power than they should. They abuse their control with giving us their lack of inspiration over and over.<br><br>Such is the case with this pathetic show.

If this show represents the 70's, all the characters behave selfishly, self absorbed, and idiotically destructive. I wonder how their friendships survive. The guy with the curly hair is the worst of the bunch, next to the dad who was Clarence of 'Robo cop'. The dad is a major jerk. The mother is an airhead. Of course, they have to have the token minority who is an embarrassment to his group. Ashton plays a real stupid guy. Who wants to watch someone act so stupid! Once may be funny but it gets to be pretty wearing. Is this what all that drug use did to people back then? No wonder there are so many adults now who refuse to grow up and just look pathetic. Not many teens find balding middle age men attractive with the pony tails and ear rings. Time to grow up!</div>

But most of the time they meet failure (examples: Getting Personal and Holding the Baby). When I first saw the previews for this show, I thought the show was interesting but also thought it wouldn't last. Well, I'm glad I was wrong. This show is very funny. The characters are hilarious and so are the stories. The creators are comedy geniuses; like that's a shock, they gave us 3rd Rock From the Sun. This show is sure to have a long life.</div>

For example the way Hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes.<br><br>Its all round classic I mean the cast, the writers, the director, its just a recipe for success. One actor i think who always gets a hard time is Ashton Kutcher but i mean he's great in this show i don't think its possible for the the character Kelso to have been played by anyone else, it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid. All the main characters are great and it wouldn't be a worth while review if i didn't mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis, now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show.</div>

I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it. I was so upset that I had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v. I loved the show so much!Finally a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough. They would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid, but not That 70s Show. That 70s Show was hilarious, smart and so real. I think it was the best show ever made and I'm very sorry that it ended. Although I love this show, I do think it should have ended on the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was just not right, Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves. I still love this show and I hope TV starts making more shows like this one.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I am a fan of the 70's Show's first two seasons, when the show was fresh and funny, but in my opinion the last six season's should never have even been produced. But my main complaint about The 70's Show is the horrible, truly disgusting manner that the male members of the cast are presented. Eric has really bad luck and he's always the butt of terrible remarks by his father, Red. Indeed, Kelso plays the fool, Fez hasn't got a clue, Hyde is a pig, Bob is a kind hearted ass, but Red Foreman takes the proverbial cake in his cowardly bullying and bitter verbal abuse of his son Eric. I believe that Red threatens to put his foot up Eric's ass at least 20 times in every episode. Red also refers to his only son as "dumb ass" at least ten times in each episode, along with the threat of physical violence on Eric. Not that Red ONLY abuses his poor miserable son Eric, Red also constantly disregards anything his poor wife Kittie suggests, and always looks out for Red first to the total exclusion of every one else. Indde, Red actually chose Kelso or Hyde over his own son in several episodes.I finally got so sick of Red's constant abuse and bullying of Eric and the rest that whenever Red spoke I would fast forward to a funny part. Again, The 70's Show was pretty good for the first two season's, after that the show just sucked.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I have to say that 'That 70s Show' is not one my favourite sitcoms. It wasn't entirely funny although the characters weren't entirely amusing, apart from the father played by Rip Torn whose phrases include 'dumbass', which was hysterical the first few times, but afterwards it became tiresome and boring. From the creators who gave us the excellent Third Rock from the Sun, this so called follow-up was somewhat of a disappointment. The ensemble cast didn't gel as well as they should've and I felt that some of them were miscasted- personally, I thought that Ashton Kutcher's character was the most annoying out of the whole lot. He was crazy yes but he did get on my nerves. On the other hand, perhaps comedy- and not drama is where his talents may lie- though he is looked down upon as someone who is unconvincing as a serial drama actor but more adept at doing comedy. Whether or not his uninspiring efforts in the Butterfly Effect and The Guardian are anything to go by, Kutcher for the moment at least is viewed by many as a TV actor well known for being in a retro-based US sitcom hit. <br><br>As far as the jokes and lines go, it wasn't consistently funny as Third Rock. Most of them were similar to other sitcoms that it wasn't as original as others made out. In a way also, the nostalgia of this show that it attempted to invoke felt out of place; hence I wasn't born in the 70s but i'm pretty sure many people who were born or have lived their lives during that decade would certainly insist that the 70s way of life, as portrayed in That 70s Show, in many ways does not reflect the experiences and types of experiences- both personal and social, people, political and social politics they had to endure and go through themselves, not to mention it was one of which defined that particular generation. <br><br>0verall, That 70s show is one of those shows which you are either a fan of or not, and I for one am very much siding to the latter.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">"That '70s Show" is probably my favorite show of all-time. It is a show that constantly makes me feel good, puts me in a good mood, and is a genuinely funny show with a lot of heart and a lot of laughs. I was pretty young when this show first came out (like...infant young), so I didn't watch it. My shows were "Barney" and the likes of "Teletubbies". And around when I was about 12/13, I claimed I didn't like the show. Truly, I had never watched it, but just seeing the commercials, I just didn't think I would enjoy it. But, I was in the kitchen one day watching part of the episode "Eric's Hot Cousin" with my mom, and we just died laughing. I couldn't tell you how amazing it felt to just gut-bust every single time someone spoke a line in the episode.<br><br>"That '70s Show" is a situational comedy that takes place in the late 1970s when gas prices were high (or non-existent) and the transition to the 1980s was inevitable. People were hungry, jobs were destroyed, and people weren't happy. Truly, it didn't seem like such a great place to be. But "That '70s Show", even with all the crap and the distaste that the '70s brought on the world, made everything seem alright, even though, in our minds, we know it wasn't. It made you feel good and just made you laugh; to see all of the gang hanging out in the basement, smoking weed, having a good time without giving a care what was going to happen to them. They were just content with living life.<br><br>The show stars Topher Grace as Eric Forman, the main protagonist. He's trying to grow up in the world as a teenager, just starting to like girls, and just starting to be at that age where he's going off and trying to break away from the world his parents deem idealistic. He wants to grow up and start living his own life and break free from the shambles that are weighing him down in his hometown, but his best friends are distracting him, the girl next door that he's in love with is distracting him, and his parents are distracting him.<br><br>Rounding off the cast is Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti, the girl next door who has fallen for Eric, and the two end up becoming more than what they used to be; Danny Masterson as Steven Hyde, the fun- loving midnight token of the gang who has a conspiracy theory for every governmentally-funded corporation and claims there's a car that runs on water; Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart, the rich and high-class socialite who believes starts off as a snob, but is eventually shown that looks and money aren't forever (even if she doesn't really care all too much); Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso, the dumb kid of the group who may be smarter than most people give him credit for; Fez, the foreign exchange student who has grown too much with popular culture and believes that he is a "smooth-talking, frisky-ass, son of a bitch"; Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith as Kitty and Red Forman, Eric's verbally-abusive father and doting mother who want the best for Eric, but don't want him wasting his life and not get anywhere or accomplish anything; Don Stark as Bob Pinciotti, Donna's father who believes the whole world is waiting for him to be on stage, though, is oblivious to her daughter's upbringings and believes that she is an angel who is innocent in every way; and Tommy Chong as Leo Chingkwake, the neighborhood hippie who owns the local photo shop and sells the kids their "film".<br><br>With an ensemble cast small enough to have each character be given a story, yet large enough to fill voids in a stage, "That '70s Show" is the perfect show for anyone looking for a great time to watch with friends, or if you're feeling in a bad mood. This show has never failed to make me laugh, and I will always love every moment of it. The characters are memorable, the dialogue never gets boring, and even after 8 years of continuous fun, the characters evolve into real people; the kids grow up into mature adults; everyone is just happy with being where they are and being who they're with. It's a great show, and I recommend it to everyone. 10/10</div>

They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back... The show was absolutely hilarious. You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. "That '70s show is the best".... It will be and always will be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes.</div>

Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso. <br><br>you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with "I'm a cool guy" kind of guy (Randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still is, not as much as the earlier seasons, but its alright.<br><br>the 360's are awesome, the circle, Red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they're cool, but not without Kelso and Eric.<br><br>great show. Dumbass!</div>

When i first time i saw it was playing on ETV(Estonian Television) And i started to like it. Too bad that that show is on bad time for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes on stupid ideas. He got these glasses which h are brown. I like it . And there's FeZ. The group Pervert. We all know what he does when his alone..... He wants to get laid badly. He even had it with his boss in one episode.His from India. And there is Michael , The stupidest guy on whole group , probably stupidest in town and his a cop! He is so stupid that i remember follows: Hyde says: Did u called cops ? - No Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off siren? He is a town playboy. Then comes Jackie , who is former girlfriend of Michael and then she's Hyde's girlfriend. Then is Eric Who's son of grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty the housewife. His one big pussy. But he loves Donna , his girlfriend with who they plan for they're marriage. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm what i forget? ah Hyde lives in a basement .</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That '70s Show is by far the funniest and most clever show on television. Each of the episodes are equally hilarious, the jokes are right on par, and the cast is great.<br><br>The writing for the series is especially funny, and the characters are given some great lines.<br><br>Each of the characters are very likable and they provide some very good laughs and fun. The stories for each of the episodes are all energetic and enjoyable to watch, and since it takes place in 1970s Wisconsin, there is plenty of nostalgia for those who grew up in the era. There are loads of references to '70s icons that those from the generation will easily pick up on. Great sitcom. 10/10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I love this show. Period. I haven't been watching very long, probably only about six months or so, actually, but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while. I love all of the characters, except I don't really care for Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just..don't find her funny, and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Other than her, I find the rest of the cast pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Erics parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike a lot of fans, I did not completely hate the 8th season. I still watch it, and it does make me laugh. But, if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons, its..not good. Randy is horrible. The finale was decent, nothing amazing, but good. =] I do think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but oh well. I have the fourth season on DVD, and someday I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of its most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were 'Dine&amp;Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red&amp;Stacey', and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I've seen so far, which is most of them, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I was surprised to see that That's 70s Show had a series finale only just a few days ago, expecting that this show had ended some time ago. For me, although it was a great sitcom (and probably the last tolerable sitcom on American network TV), it had jumped the sharked many seasons earlier, even before key players made their exits. Once the gang graduated from high school, and the seventies seemed to a perpetually exhausting decade, prolonged almost by necessity of the title of the show, it became incredibly sophomoric in its humor, and rather dry compared to the carefree high school years. At that time (the first two or three seasons, I don't know), the group was more innocent and that they lounged around in Foreman's basement and carried on idiotic conversations was amusing. But, by the time they became older, officially became graduates, shared lovers (and particularly the relationship on-again, off-again between "Hot Donna" and her nerdly beau, Eric) became quite annoying. For me, the only thing left to laugh at in the show was Kitty's (Debra Jo Rupp) optimisism and Red's (Kurtwood Smith) short fuse, and, when he was around, the dazed hippie, Leo (Tommy Chong). The other characters had become trite and the writing had stooped to sophomoric build-up and delivery. The characters may have advanced beyond high school, but it seems that little else about them did and soon enough, That's 70s Show no longer because the savior of prime time television, and quickly fell into the same stupor as the rest of the dismal crap the networks have to offer in no short amount.<br><br>Credit should be given, too, for capturing most of the 1970s, especially the costumes, music, and settings, although failing in the dialog, and as such, still offering something unique about this particular sitcom. It was indeed well-done to a point, but perhaps those behind the development of this show had suffered the same problems of those behind Malcom in the Middle - the hype eventually took over the better elements and settled for what could be standardized.</div>

I'm so very tired of the CIF, who has popped up in every television show over the last fifty years from I Love Lucy to Whoopi.  "Oh, let's put in a guy who has a funny voice.  The audience can laugh at him when he says stupid things in his funny voice." Just try to think of a show without a CIF.  Can't do it, can you?<br><br>Irritating immigrant accents aside, this show is poorly written.  The jokes are so flat and lifeless, and the plot so dim, and the characters so sarcastic and unlikeable, that it is a wonder this show has been on for so long.  See, Wings and Cheers can help me refinish my hardwood floors, but That 70s Show does nothing but make me stop my housework and try to figure out why it has been on for five years.  No one I know watches this program. Why is it still on the air?</div>

But 'That '70s Show' just doesn't do a thing for me.<br><br>I just feel it tries too hard to be like the '70s. Now even though I didn't get to experience them for myself, I can safely assume that they really weren't anything like this show. I'm also sure it's not meant to be realistic, but it's just painful to watch in my case. Most of the characters have an IQ lower than their waistline, especially Kelso, who I loathe with a hot firey passion.<br><br>I TRIED liking this show for quite some time, but I realized I just couldn't. It's basically rehashed jokes from modern day sitcoms, but in earth tones.<br><br>I know that a lot of sitcoms that were really from the '70s weren't that great either, but at least they didn't make a big deal out of their pants.<br><br>Maybe I just don't have the right kind of sense of humor to like 'That '70s Show.' I go for intelligent, well thought out humor from Gene Wilder movies and such, not fluffy sitcoms. A show about the '70s could be brilliant, but this is just badly written trash. To me anyway.</div>

This is my favorite show ever! All of the charcters are hilarious and the show always keeps you laughing whether it's Kelso's stupidness or Jackie's snobiness. All of the actors are great, and Red &amp; Kitty are also very funny. This is one show that I watch almost every night. If you've never watched this show, watch it now! You won't regret it! I give That 70's Show a 10/10!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That '70s Show is among one of my favorite sitcoms, and that's why I feel a little bad out giving it a 7.0/10 rating, but I felt I had no choice, as the wrapping up of Season 6 to the Season 8 finale was nothing but disappointing to me. I feel the show would have a better legacy if it had actually ended earlier, maybe at the end of Season 6. <br><br>I thought the cast overall was pretty talented, although if I had a problem with any of the acting it would be that of Laura Prepon. I didn't particularly find her acting believable, it was kind of stiff and didn't seem as authentic as her castmates. I didn't dislike her acting enough to dismiss her, or her character of Donna, it just seems that, compared to her colleagues, she didn't quite have the comedic talents they did. Apparently she was quite new to acting at that time, and maybe that explains it, as people have said she's great on 'Orange Is The New Black' (I have no desire to watch that show to be honest), but maybe she developed better acting skills as the years passed after That '70s Show. <br><br>Ok, the first 5 seasons were good (although I wasn't a huge fan of the Casey Kelso/Donna arc, although I can understand they needed to throw in something different, some turbulence for Eric &amp; Donna to overcome), and the beginning of Season 6 was promising, but ended in the characters of Eric and Donna doing things that were, up to that point, pretty uncharacteristic of them. Eric, who was always almost obsessively devoted to and wanted to be with Donna forever suddenly gets cold feet and stands her up at the altar. And Donna, who speaks, along with Eric, many times about wanting to escape from their podunk town and move out of Point Place suddenly wants to stay living there and live in a trailer in a dingy trailer park? One could say that Donna's out of character trailer park dream in town spurred Eric to ditch her at the wedding, but I thought it was an insult to viewers to have Donna, then Eric, do things that completely didn't go along with the character that had been established through 5 full seasons. <br><br>Season 7 was a waste of time. The previous season's ending was explained away that Eric &amp; Donna "just weren't ready for marriage", which is whatever, not too far fetched, but ok. Eric is just being a lazy slob for a year, and him and Donna are still dating, but the Eric/Donna dynamic is just kind of boring and stagnant during this season. <br><br>Season 8 was terrible in a lot of ways, I'm sure this has been covered sufficiently enough by other reviewers, so I won't get too into it. <br><br>I just wish this show would have lasted, say, 6 seasons and that Eric &amp; Donna, whether married or just dating, would go off to Madison, get a place, and start college, and Hyde, Kelso, Fez, and Jackie would have their storylines go whatever directions, just not the directions that ended up actually getting written. I just feel like I, and others, invested our interest and time and were rewarded with a great show, only to be insulted during the last two seasons, particularly the last season, it kind of sours the overall show for me, because no matter how great and hilarious the good seasons were, the fact the show went downhill, then out, like it did, is annoying.</div>

Each episodes are simply hilarious. I especially liked the relationship between the foreman parents and the kids. The interior sets are are fun to watch and the cloths they wear are totally hip.<br><br>You might also be able to feel bittersweet and nostalgic from their experiences through the seasons with those great '70s tunes.<br><br>Don't think "It's just a stupid sitcom for kids".

                <div class="text show-more__control">Great television shows ought end their run on a high note. With the exit of Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher, so too should have this series ended its wonderful run. Instead Fox decided to torture its fans with an 8th Season featuring the remaining too-old actors playing teens, and introducing Josh Meyers in a role for which he is totally unsuited, uncool and not in the least bit funny. Certainly Messrs. Kutcher and Grace had to move on with their careers. It surprises me that the rest of the troupe did not do likewise, given their talent and experience. Even a spin off would have been better than this hapless and hopefully final season. It seems that Fox has not learned from the travails of NBC and intends to compete for last place in the ratings.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Just finished watching all 200 episodes. I really never heard about this, until recently.
First episode was for me little weaker - considering acting, camera work in first place. I guess they needed little time to getting in it. And actors were really young. And now very well known names. From 5 main, only Danny Masterson was unknown for me. Actors playing parents were very good too - ah, I forgot to say that young actors made great job most of time.<br><br>It is now clear for me that it is not serial Friends, from which The Big Bang Theory learned a most. This is it. We can see really lot of similarity. Will mention only probably most striking one: obsession with Star Wars movies and what went with them. But Star Trek was there, too.<br><br>Humor was great, very good most of time, although I ask my self, would all it pass some today's PC 'standards' ? Some was on the edge of good taste. It is really hard to describe it with few words. Watch it and will see - and laugh.<br><br>The love stories were for me weaker part. But this is comedy in first place, so that's fine.<br><br>I would give it 9, but I think that there was too much dope related in it. Surely, those years were filled with it, among younger too (and today is surely not better). There was some 'stash' talk in almost every episode.<br><br>This was surely very popular when went on TV. And proof for that is big number of famous guest starts: Luke Wilson, Brooke Shields, Roger Daltrey ...
Classic, for sure.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I remember quite vividly watching my very first episode of That '70s Show. I was with my friends and what caught my attention about the show were the characters. I remember Donna, a tall redheaded beauty, and since I was a giant female amongst my peers, I related to her in a way that was almost like we were sisters. All the characters are likeable and play their part very well, especially Fez with his corky accent and Kittie with her adorably cute laugh. Another interesting thing about the show is that in between the scenes, they have cartoon flowers that fall and fill up the screen along with colorful pictures pop ups; these images are quite satisfying to watch, especially when someone is high. I remember when I made the realization that when the core group of friends gathered together in that dark smokey circle in the middle of Eric's basement, they were getting high off their damn minds. It was then where I felt like I adopted this life style, of living in the clouds. I highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys laughing, if you love to laugh, watch this show.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I really loved this show. There were almost no bad episodes. The first few seasons were absolutely perfect. The last one was not as great because two of the main characters were gone but they still managed to keep it at a good level and ended it at a right time.<br><br>Like with many shows there were some problems with characters after a few seasons. The running jokes of Kitty drinking and Fez being a perv in a closet were a bit annoying. And I didn't like Hyde when he was dating Jackie. Usually he was a great character but then he was mainly getting on my nerves.<br><br>I don't know 70's so I don't know how accurate it was but I liked it being set in a different decade. This way the references to that time sometimes made the show funner and more original.<br><br>Each character was great and well thought out. My favorite though was Mrs. Kitty. Hilarious and amazing acting. I was also surprised to find out that many of the actors never had an acting jib before the show because they were all so good.<br><br>I wish they would make That 90's Show now.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">It has now been over ten years since the end of one of the most iconic television shows of the last 30 years. I hold out hope for a reunion show, or a TV movie. I believe all fans want the same. It could be based in the late 90s and show what has happened since December 31, 1979 (when the show ended).<br><br>It would be great to see Eric, Donna, Hyde, Fez, Jackie and Kelso again (especially since Kelso and Jackie are together in real life). One has to wonder what they've been up to. How have they been doing? Has Hyde been in prison? Have Jackie and Kelso married and divorced? One can wonder. What about Red and Kitty?<br><br>A reunion show could answer so many questions, and the gang could be back together, in the circle or not. Someone at Fox, make this happen before they're all gone.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Small-town Wisconsin in the '70s never looked good. Of course, if any small town friend group had the combination of Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, and Laura Prepon, it may really have been that cool to be in Point Place, despite the gang's complaints.<br><br>Outside of that, "That '70s Show" is a feel-good comedy, that while starting with a more serious tone in the first season, soon transitions into wonderfully outrageous fun. It doesn't lack for charm either, and the romantic trials of Eric and Donna contribute a lot of heart. It definitely weakens in its final seasons, but it is consistently funny in its glory years.<br><br>(I saw all of this show in March 2017, and in pieces before and after.)</div>

Recommend everyone to watch this, you will not regret.The best thing about this show is the comedy timings and the characters. Everyone can relate themselves with any one of the characters. It is just brilliant!!<br><br>My Favourite Characters in sequence: Michael Kelso ,Red Forman ,Hyde ,Kitty ,Fez ,Eric ,Jackie ,Donna.<br><br>This show is consistently funny in all the 8 seasons.

                <div class="text show-more__control">This show is great it is funny in a relaxing type of way. I would not say the funniest of all time but in my top 10. I feel that everyone was casted perfect. In this show I feel very connected with the whole cast. I feel like I'm part of the crew just hanging in the basement. If you don't know what the show is about basically it's just about the average teen in the 70s who watch TV, go out, smoke pot, and get into trouble. I love the basement I think it's cool that the crew is fine with hanging out all day. And of course there is the legendary group bonding known as "the circle". Basically the circle is they sit in a circle and smoke pot and laugh and tell funny stories. Most of the characters participate in the circle at least one point in the show but the main guys are Eric foreman, Stephen Hyde, fez, Michael kelso. But Donna and Jackie do participate sometimes to and Leo the dirty hippie played by tommy Chong. Eric foreman is probably my favorite character I love how he is pretty much a geek with his love for GI Joe, Star Wars, batman, comic books, and action figures. He doesn't really care and always makes things funny. It's also awesome when his dad red foreman yells at him. Michael Kelso (Ashton kutcher) is my second favorite. Kelso known as the idiot of the group always saying stupid things and falling off the water tower provides one of the best characters on the show. Hyde is awesome too him being the biggest stoner of the group he is also constantly showing his paranoia of the government taking over and his hate for cops. Leo a rare character who appears sometimes showed up randomly as Hyde's boss. Leo is constantly forgetting everything and seems to be out of it 100% of the time. The show was great up until the last season season 8. Although it was still funny it was tough because both Eric and kelso were gone so that took away about half the jokes. What I did like is Leo became a bigger part and they also tried to add randy played by josh Meyers who in my opinion was not funny at all he really only said like a funny thing every 3 or 4 episodes even though they tried to every episode. The show really wasn't awesome season 8 but I still recommend it</div>

His friends share their lives and share their weed spending time in the basement.<br><br>It's amazing to see the young stars Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Wilmer Valderrama, and Ashton Kutcher. They form the core of a hilarious fun group that the audience would love to be a part of. Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith play the Forman parents. Not only was this a funny series, it was a fun group to watch. It had some innovative elements which is rare to see. It's all been done before, and seeing something new in a TV sitcom almost never happens. The show lasted for 8 seasons. There was some drop off in the final 2 years after some of the actors left. The first several is still hilarious after multiple watching.</div>

All the actors worked well together to make the punch lines come on time and cause me to giggle every time. They all played their characters to near perfection, and I was impressed during every episode. <br><br>The final season is the reason it's not getting a 10/10. Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher leave the show, and a new guy who can barely say his lines takes their place. Then there's also the fact that the writers seemed to get lazy and all the humor became irritating and stupid. I barely made it to the end.</div>

The parents are all great and I would say maybe the greatest part of the whole show. Eric is okay and his girlfriend is not very good. I would say that her initial personality is good but her storyline is basically "BE ERICS GIRLFRIEND." You know, in Phineas and Ferb and in many other shows. The boy and girl who obviously like each other, dont actually go together. It's for these cute moments. We always ask, "oh please just get together." But in this show. No. Eric and that one girl who has a voice manlier than mine, are very awkward and confused, and that's they way they should be! They're dating is the most annoying and cringy thing to watch. I hate watching them together. They feel so weird. I loved the first few episodes and it was because they were cute, awkward, but they weren't actually together. Now that they're together, they should be romantic but theyre so weird. I hate them on screen together and thecharacter, Eric, who was initially great is now hard to watch. I can't continue. Oh yeah everyone else is good. Also the laugh track is terrible.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I am in awe of the fact that FOX has finally come up with something that can truly contend with ANY other network's programming.  That 70's Show chronicles the lives of six high school teens growing up in suburban (not to mention fictitious) Point Place Wisconsin.  Every week this show is nothing short of brilliant.  The characters are all essentially good natured, pot smoking, rock and roll loving all American kids.  Each character has some diverse qualities that clearly sets them apart from one another.  Topher Grace is excellent as Eric, who is essentially the central character. Topher can play the character straight to a tee, however his comic timing and presence is unbelievable.  He manages to be incredibly funny without being incredibly stupid and over the top (like Kelso).  Whether dealing with the cynical Hyde, the naive but somehow hip Fez, the annoying Jackie or the alluring Donna, That 70's Show guarantees to entertain.  A huge amount of praise has to go to Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp who play Eric's parents, Red and Kitty.  They work incredibly well together and manage to be so out of touch with the kids at times, yet at other moments they are overly hip.  They are perfect together and are integral to the show's success.  I particularly love Red for his no - nonsense attitude towards everything and dead pan humor.  Kurtwood Smith (after years of playing character roles - mainly violent criminals I might add) really stands out and should earn him self an Emmy soon.<br><br>There is just so much to like about this show.  Especially the revolving camera when Eric and his friends are stoned in his basement.  This is always hysterical.  I can honestly say that the only thing  don't like about this show is the fact that they let Cheap Trick do the theme song this year.  The original version was so much better.<br><br>That 70's Show has renewed what little faith I had left in network programming.  Lets hope that FOX can follow  up with something else that is half as good.<br><br>SSB - December 8, 1999 - NYC</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">For quite a while I was convinced that this was a good show, largely from the strength of the first season. The first season was very honest and open, and all of the characters were quite well developed. The driving story was obviously that of Eric and Donna - a well-written teenage romance surrounded by interesting characters and funny jokes.<br><br>However during the second season things began to change. Suddenly everything seemed to be about feminism. Midge, the nextdoor neighbor, began talking about her "needs" and how Bob was an ass for not respecting them. Several shows revolved around comedically showing Midge trying to reach her goals, and Bob not understanding. Little heed was paid to the fact that Midge was a spoiled housewife who did nothing to aid the family, and that putting her own dreams in front of her family was selfish. Bob was just an ass for not understanding. I mean, how offensive is it to be asked to cook a meal for a person who works all day putting a roof over your head? The nerve of some people!<br><br>Then the worst thing possible happened: Donna became virtually the same character as Midge. In every episode dealing with their relationship, Eric would do something goofy or stupid (or which would be characterized as goofy or stupid), and he would end up apologizing to Donna. Again and again and again. Finally, when Eric asks Donna for a commitment we are expected to accept that this is wrong (because Donna is selfish and wants to put her individual dreams ahead of her relationship). So they break up, and then most of the fourth season deals with why Eric is such a dumbass for losing her, why he is wrong, why Donna is right and such a great catch, and so forth. Not once does the story revolve around why Donna was wrong for her attitude, or how she made mistakes. Because she's female, and thus perfect.<br><br>The attitude is visible in every aspect of the show. All the men beg for sex, and women grant them the favor ... if they're lucky. The men buy the women gifts and fret about how they may not be doing enough for their relationship. The women just complain about how stupid the guys are. Examine this show a little more closely. Kitty is the perfect mom, Red is the brutish and ignorant dad. Donna is the perfect woman, Eric is the goon boyfriend. Midge is the enlightened woman, Bob is an idiot. When Midge abandons her family it is ok because she was "unhappy", but Hyde's dad is a loser for leaving his family. Ah, the justice of the double standard.<br><br>"That 70's Show" became just another victim of the female market, like so many other shows during the early 2000's. In the spirit of revamped new-age feminism, women were consistently portrayed as the sage, wise members of a relationship, and men as the childish goons who always mess everything up. For years this paradigm has been visible, from prime-time dramas to comedy to commercials. Strange that nobody sees this as offensive. Obviously the common sense position is that men and women are  of equal potential intelligence and both need to give up some things to have a relationship. But common sense doesn't sell, does it?<br><br>Most recently the show has become annoying because the stories aren't developed anymore, it's all about the joke. Like all Fox sitcoms which last more than three years, the show has become jarringly self-referential and complacent. Which is a sad ending to a show that had so much promise.</div>

becoming dumber becuse graduation greades and.. keep droping and kids turn more and more into emotional snowflakes... what a shame... (the fact that the educetional system is broken has nothing to do with the show... it's just sad to see that a character that was ment to be funny and eccentric is common this days)<br><br>but the story is solit and it's more then a well done tv show...<br><br>brings back memories

I began watching it about three years ago, and to this day it's still my favorite! Each cast member brings a little something to the show, and they all have great chemistry together on set. This show never fails to make me laugh and even though I've seen every episode numerous times over, I still laugh hysterically each time watch it. Although Season 8 was a bust, (because Eric and Kelso, who happen to be my two favorite characters were gone) the show still had an amazing run and never failed to keep me laughing. Eric's awkwardness, Kelso's stupidity, Fez's perverted mind, Hyde's bad ass attitude, Jackie's bitchy style, Donna's independence, Red's anger, and Kitty's cheerful laugh made this show what is was, and it's always gunna be my favorite! If you wanna have a good laugh, T7S is what you need to watch.</div>

With an excellent cast, and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to TV after dinner. With the constant changing of relationships and finding out who Hyde's real dad is, this show was a hit when it started in August of 98, though it was set in 1976. And hanging out in Foremans basement was always the thing to do back then, and it still is today, along with circles.This show gave great laughs in premieres, and it still does during re-runs. If you watch a few episodes of this show, you will get everything and want to get more. Now only is this show one of the best ever created, it is clever and funny.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">As of this writing,it's been over 2 weeks since "That 70's Show" aired it's finale.<br><br>Like I suspected from the beginning when the show debuted (assuming it would last) the last episode took place on New Year's Eve 1979. I remember that night in 1979 myself,I was 11 and it was the first time I really got to stay up and ring in the new year. So it was sort of like living it all over again.<br><br>....but! Getting back to the show,I sat down at my TV in Aug. of 1998 to watch this highly anticipated show. Since I had been a kid in this decade and had seen my oldest brother do much of the same things back then,it was a given I'd tune in. <br><br>The first episode was good but of course,first shows of almost any series are never spectacular. The kids' taking the Vista Cruiser out of town was a good start as well as the first kiss between Donna &amp; Eric. That moment in the show basically set the stage for the rest of the show. Their relationship was dealt with in a funny,sometimes dramatic,touching and responsible manner which served the series well.<br><br>In time,every member of this cast (with some of the most unusual names I had ever read),became funnier and more entertaining to watch. Kitty became a little ditzier but not stupid thankfully,Red sometimes showed a soft spot while still threatening to put his foot somewhere. Eric went from nerd to a self-confident young man. Kelso never really changed but became a responsible father after his bed-hopping ways finally resulted in a baby.<br><br>Fez was sort of stereotype at first,living with his "sponsored straight laced parents". They thankfully vanished because they weren't funny. Jackie,is the ultimate "I love me and so do you" kind of character,she's the typical spoiled rich girl who,because she's dating Michael,gets into a group she doesn't really belong in. I was glad to see her give Kelso the boot!<br><br>Hyde is the only one to pretty much be the same the whole show. He was an anti-establishment young rebel at the start and despite taking on responsibilities and ending up living with the Formans,he never yielded that personality. Midge and Bob were hilarious 70s type adults who wanted to try the latest things and did. Especially Bob's obvious fake Tom Jones like hair. Leo was just plain spaced out and funny.<br><br>To put this in perspective,the characters almost perfectly mirrored the guys and girls my brother hung out with. My brother would be Eric (until he turned into a Hyde). He had a female friend who behaved a bit like Eric's sister Laurie. <br><br>He had a goofy Kelso like friend and a couple of girls in our neighborhood were like Donna &amp; Jackie (but they didn't get along). Even in Fez (who we finally find out is from Brazil)my brother had a Puerto Rican friend who talked kind of funny. <br><br>The best thing about this show is not that it's just a look back at a time I &amp; others grew up in,it's that it didn't ignore the things that went on in those days. That's the real key to why "That 70s Show" was a success. <br><br>They kept it real,while keeping it funny. Note:The series ended 30 years to the month that's mentioned in the first show (May,1976!)(END)</div>

School, friends, romance, even sex and the "circles", these are what the teenagers are going through, that' 70's show first came on the TV screens in all our families as the fresh, unique and funny sitcom that made us laugh, made us know that life should be worshiped and cherished. The 8th season started out fine, because that Kelso was in it, but then Randy ruined the show completely. As for Donna being blonde, she just looks ridiculous and she is not as innocent and hot as she was. Hyde still keeps his cool though, and FEZ is creepier than ever. I hope that Eric would come back sooner, i liked topher's performance in " In Good Company". For all the fans of this show out there, Keep on watching, keep on rocking, and keep on grooving!</div>

I wish they kept Hyde and Jackie together or the new writer got them to find there back together in the 8th season. I don't like that Jackie and Fez end up together. -_- That's the only thing that made me give me them a lower score. It killed the ending of the series.</div>

Everything about this show was artificial retro goodness, as it was shot more than twenty years later its actual timeline. Characters were hysterical and despite that awful 7th season, with that unfunny Napoleon Dynamite actor, the whole run is a lot to enjoy. I'm sure it has a long future of reruns and other programs ahead. And it sure deserves it.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Great plot, a lot of jokes. The outfits and sets are spot on, and everytime I finish watching an episode I kinda feel like I time travelled from the 1970s to 2020. All the characters are very likable, but they all also have flaws so they don't come off as over the top perfect. Would definitely reccomend watching this show :)</div>

It's one of those rare TV shows that you must see. I own the whole series on disc and still watch it 14 years after the series ended.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I was too young to take in That 70s Show when it originally aired. I recently watched the first season on Netflix and plan to take in more of it. So many stars were either in the cast or guest starred on the show. To be filmed 20-25 years after its setting, it's very well placed in its time. I don't think the show gets enough credit for its quality costuming, set design and writing. All are great in my opinion.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">5/18/18. I binged-watched the entire 8 seasons and enjoyed this throwback to the '70s. It managed to survive the MIA Grace and Kutcher during the last season and ended series on high note when these 2 returned for the finale. Perhaps, the most essential plot line was the ongoing relationship between Eric and Donna during adolescence, ups and downs, warts and all. The character I ended up liking a lot was Rupp's Kitty Forman, a TV mom that everyone would like to have as their mom. Her role in the final episode reminded me so much of how the Wizard of Oz's Dorothy treated her traveling companions on the road to Oz. A good sit-com that's worth your time.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70's Show was one of the few TV series of that time which made it past 100 episodes. It had many USPs - the circle, their dream fantasies, Kitty's laugh, split screens, wacky transitions and their catchy theme song with the "Hello Wisconsin" cry. Also, Was Cosmo this popular?<br><br>It blended comedy with light social commentary e.g. Economic slowdown and the outsourcing of American jobs, attitude towards immigrants, rise of feminism, lack of a stable home, no higher education (Eric, Kelso, Fez, Hyde and Jackie never attended college)<br><br>Popmatters had this to say-<br><br>"That 70s Show takes appropriately complex moral stands about the decade that launched much of what is still considered "progressive." Sex before marriage is okay if two people love each other, like Eric and Donna. But it only leads to complications if it's done for the wrong reasons, as is the case with Kelso....... Light drugs, like pot or booze, are okay and even fun in moderation. Hard drugs are bad and lead inevitably to trouble. Feminism is a good thing. But, still, there's nothing wrong with being a housewife."<br><br>Maybe I found it at a time when nothing made sense, similar to adolescence. Still it wasn't without its pitfalls. At times mostly in the latter half, I felt that the jokes were repetitive and the only thing that kept me going was the desire to see it till the end.<br><br>The lack of stable characters bugged me a lot, Midge (Donna's mother), Laurie (Eric's sister), Leo (my favorite guy), disappearance of Eric and Kelso in the last season (making the last season my least favorite despite the ending being good - especially Donna).<br><br>Despite all of this, That 70's show is not about any of these. At it's essence, it is about the smaller stuff, the unseen moments of adolescence, that which seems to last an eternity, during a time when we haven't traveled around or experienced enough to know better. For a show that never found a huge audience, it ran for 200 episodes, plenty of time for enjoying the same song every day<br><br>Hanging out; Down the street; The same old thing; We did last week; Not a thing to do; But talk to you; We're all alright!; We're all alright!; Hello Wisconsin!!<br><br>Damn!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Watching That 70s show and especially seeing the fashion I wonder what possessed anyone to wear those bellbottoms which you could so easily trip over and those platform shoes which no doubt gave a whole generation feet issues in their middle age. I had both and they looked good, but a hidden price.<br><br>Meet the Forman family in whose basement the kids of That 70s Show gathered to talk on life and love. Topher Grace was the host with everyone's favorite den mother Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty and the father Kurtwood Smith who had all kinds of old fashioned ideas and couldn't understand the younger generation.<br><br>The friends were Danny Masterson who was hip and with it, AShton Kutcher who you couldn't believe was so good looking and had so little upstairs and their new friend who had a name so unpronounceable that they took to calling Wilmer Valderrama FES (foreign exchange student). <br><br>The girls auxiliary was Laura Prepon who lived next door and was into this newfangled feminism and Mila Kunis who was as emptyheaded as Laura was wise. It was Kunis who had in my opinion the best line in the entire run of the show where she said 'nothing will ever deter me from my life's goal to be a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.<br><br>Prepon's parents were Tanya Roberts who left the show and her father Don Stark who tried to stay as hip as he could to keep up with the kids and who Kurtwood Smith mercilessly put down for it. Truth be told Stark looked ridiculous, as ridiculous as I would if I now tried to wear 70s fashions. Or even some of today's.<br><br>Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis had the biggest success since That 70s Show ended, the others have done pretty good. Two that are no longer with us are Brittany Murphy the older Forman sister and Tommy Chong the aging hippie left over from the 60s. <br><br>This show had some great comedy in it. Wonder what these characters think of the American scene now?</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This is the show that launched the careers of Topher Grace,Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis now that I've watched it I know why they got recognized for it because this show is awesome it's consistently funny except for some episodes in Season 8 because there's one character Randy who almost completely ruins the final season that character sucked. I love all the characters in this they're awesome they're all lovable...Kelso the moron,Hyde the bad boy,Fez the funny foreigner,Jackie the spoiled brat,Eric the smart mouth,Donna the hot redhead and Leo the old stoner hippie who was first introduced in Season 2 as Hyde's boss at a photo hut then written off for awhile because the actor Tommy Chong went to jail. The reason they had to bring on a new character in Season 8 was because Topher Grace who plays Eric went to film Spider-Man 3 his performance in that was terrible so in my opinion it was not a good move in this show he's amazing I can't pick a favorite character because I love them all everything about this show is satisfying also closer to the end something happened that you'd never expect I won't spoil it I highly recommend you see this show if you haven't.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I really love this show. It's funny, I love how it's set in the 1970s. I do find it strange that the series went for eight years, yet the show is only based from 1976 to December 31st, 1979. Maybe they did that so all of the things we see when he think of the 1970s are already popular and established. If you started in 1971, the sixties would still be the major decade. This show has a great cast, hilarious characters, and funny, sad, and interesting story lines. My favorite seasons are definitely Season 5 and 6. Then I like the earlier ones, and then the later ones. From best to worst: Season 5 + 6 (tie), Season 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 (tie), Season 7, Season 8. My favorite characters are definitely Jackie, Kelso and Fez. They're all hilarious.<br><br>This show is about a group of teenagers living in Wisconsin in the late 1970s, where we see them go through many adventures. <br><br>Overall, I give this TV show an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">When the show first began with seasons 1 thru 3, it was an amazingly effective mixture of innocence and decadence. The characters were discovering themselves and we were discovering them simultaneously. The innocence was amazing to behold. Many of them were sexually active, yet so unknowing of the much more difficult and complex terrain of falling in love and committing to one another. <br><br>Each character brought something unique to the table. Certain shows are really successful because instead of one character in the center of attention while everyone else is sort of "reactionary", each character, whether adult or teen, commands attention. Two of my favorite characters are Red (Kurtwood Smith) and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), the caring but overly authoritarian father and the nervous-natured, peacemaking mother of Eric Forman (Topher Grace), a sweet, slightly built boy who is falling in love with longtime neighbor and friend Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon), a tall, athletic, beautiful redhead who loves and appreciates Eric as much as he does her, especially his understanding of her embarrassment about her parents, two sexually adventurous sometimes- swingers, the hilarious Bob (Don Stark), and the dizzy but very loving Midge (Tanya Roberts). <br><br>As Eric and Donna shyly tiptoe into a romantic association, they spend much of their time in Eric's basement hanging out, watching TV (and frequently indulging in smoking weed) with their childhood friends Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson) an intelligent but rebellious boy who habitually wears sunglasses indoors and often discusses conspiracy theories; Jackie Burkhart (Mila Kunis), a beautiful petite brunette who is self-centered and bitchy and starts out as an unwanted "Yoko" in the group; Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), Jackie's boyfriend, who is just as beautiful as she is, but much less snobby, and unfortunately, a little light in the brain; and Fez aka F.E.S. (the Foreign Exchange Student)whose birth name and country of origin remain unknown (I'm currently watching season 8 and I'm not sure if these 2 items will ever be divulged :). It is a delight whenever Red Forman calls the boy "Sabu" or "Haji". Like Archie Bunker, Red Forman is a bit on the close-minded side, but he is still very lovable :D<br><br>This show was at its finest during the first 4-5 seasons, with genuinely funny and nostalgic story lines and storytelling styles. Around seasons 5-7 it began to lose steam. Eric Forman goes thru a transformation from a nervous wreck living in fear of the wrath of Red to a lazy and unfunny smart-mouth. In truth, Eric always had a "porky" mouth, but it was in a hilarious way in the early days. Red's "foot in your ass" liners became more and more infrequent. Kitty went through a disappointing change from a delightful basketcase with that unforgettable giggle to a rather mean, judgmental woman, drinking more and more and calling Donna a whore after Eric ends their longtime relationship and Donna begins dating Randy (the character meant to replace both Eric and Kelso after Grace and Kutcher left in season 8). No offense to the actor who plays Randy, but with Grace and Kutcher gone, there is just nothing much to be fired up about, and Randy is just annoying. His delivery of the lines seems more like those actual cheesy, unfunny 70s shows.<br><br>I didn't hate ALL of the story lines from the later seasons: Hyde's discovery that he is biracial; Hyde's competetive half sister Angie, Kelso fathering a baby, Fez and Kelso trying to share an apartment, and Hyde's drunken marriage to a Las Vegas stripper were all pretty decent. Still, without Eric's centering presence and Kelso's hilarious goofiness, it's just tolerable. I also greatly missed the hilarity that Lisa Robin Kelly (RIP) brought to this mix as the promiscuous and devilishly funny Laurie Forman.<br><br>If they are doing a reunion show or movie, it will be interesting to see what has transpired in the early 80s :D</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I attached such high expectations to this last episode! As it played out, it was like watching an over-inflated balloon deflate from a slow leak. It will be as shows to watch and re-watch to glean more through inferences. I was hoping for more loose ends to be tied up. Red retired in an earlier episode of the 8th season after selling his muffler shop to a huge retail chain. But in the last episode Kitty was dressed in her nurse's uniform. I guess she is still working. Since they are not moving to Florida, I suspect she will continue to work until she retires. Bob sold his house and is still moving to Florida to open a bait shop. Fez is still working at the hair shop. Will he marry Jackie? Who knows? She's older and maybe not as flighty. What work will she do? Maybe she will be the make-up and nail girl once Fez opens his own shop. Hyde owns the record store, thanks to his father's "bequeath." Since his "wife" already had a husband, that marriage is null and void. Who will he hook up with? The biker girl from earlier in the show's history? With his new attitude, maybe he can straighten out Leo  NO WAY! Kelso is just plain Kelso. He's kept his job at Playboy in Chicago for a whole season now, and actually got promoted. Maybe he and Brooke will finally tie the knot, and she will elevate his intellect. He is still a devoted father to their daughter. Donna is starting college right after New Years. I couldn't picture her being a DJ for the rest of her life. If she majors in communications or journalism (remember her story writing episodes?), she might be a broadcast journalist. I'm puzzled at Eric's part in this last episode. He said he had so much hope when he left for Africa, but now he's not so sure. Surely he won't waste his internship there and NOT go to college! Obviously he and Donna have matured. Their intense feelings for each other are still there, as evidenced by that kissing scene. I see their relationship heading toward marriage. It just has to!! If they can get past their college days without killing each other. Kitty casts some doubt on that possibility (before Eric's return, though) when she tells Donna she's sorry things didn't work out between her and Eric. The show has not one, but two, characters who suffered from the "Chuck Cunningham Syndrome." Fans of "Happy Days" know what I'm talking about. Laurie, Eric's older sister, and Tina, Donna's little sister from episode 6 of season1. They both just disappeared from the show. I'm trying to remember an episode that explained Laurie moving away. She trained for a while as a hair dresser. Maybe she will return, and go to work for Fez and Jackie. To Kitty's credit, she DOES ask where Laurie is, in the last episode. It was always mentioned that Jackie was a year younger than the rest of the gang. And THEY graduated from high school in a 2003 episode that had "1978" on the license plate. Ergo, she had to graduate in 1979. This last episode is set on December 31, 1979. She's about 18. Eric, Donna, Hyde, and Fez are about 19. Kelso is 20 if he was held back a year. Two characters who joined the show in the last season, Randy and Samantha, felt the wrath of devoted fans on internet forums. They just didn't seem to fit in with the established ensemble cast. Their parts just sort of fizzled out. Casey Kelso, Michael's older brother, deserves an honorable mention. How can he be so lovable and annoying at the same time? Internet forums have discussed favorite episodes or characters. When the show first started, I couldn't stand the Fez and Jackie characters. He was too much of a mousy, clinging vine. She was too much like the girls I wanted to date in high school, but couldn't. As the show progressed, that switched and I found Donna to be condescending and Eric kind of whiny. As the series matured, I slowly understood that's how they all fit in to the overall "big picture" of the show. All members contributed to the success of the show. That's the meaning of "ensemble cast." They are like the building blocks of a pyramid. All serve to form a solid structure. Unfortunately, in the last season, two primary cornerstones of the foundation were removed when Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left. The structure wobbled severely and nearly tumbled down. Favorite episodes? IMPOSSIBLE! Favorite scenes from different episodes, maybe: When Red and Eric visit Laurie at her apartment, and catch her shacked up her current boyfriend. Eric laughing at Laurie at the end of that scene is classic! Kitty and Hyde at Fenton's jewelry store, when Kitty realizes "her ring" is actually Donna's engagement ring. THEN Hyde declaring he "just now" found out. Even better, later in that episode when Red finds out Eric is engaged and Kitty declares the same. That look on Hyde's face! In the 100th episode "That Seventies Muscial" when Jackie loses at Rock-Paper-Scissors, and has to put more dog poop on the music teacher's porch. That look on her face and her flighty arm waving in "fast-forward" when she drops it off and runs away. And the all time best: At Bob's and Midge's re-marriage ceremony, when Midge is reading the vows that Donna wrote, Eric realizes she's writing about them. He slowly turns to see Donna mouthing "I Love You" just as Midge says the same thing. This started as a review of the last episode. It ended as a review of the entire series, and an attempt to extrapolate possible futures from the momentum of past episodes and analysis of the final show. Hopefully a success.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This show is really great, when I first saw it a few years ago I thought it was the dumbest show that ever happened. But then it grew on me very quickly, Eric is my favorite character because he has the same outlook on life that I do. Hyde is also one of my favorite's he's got a nice laid back attitude and always has a funny comment, whether its mean or just weird. It's sad that this show is ending, just when I was starting to like it. Since I was born in the late 80's I never saw the seventies, but from my parents old photos That 70's Show is very accurate. This show keeps me laughing with every episode. Everyone I know watches it too. If I could rate this show on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it an 11! :)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">There are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. That 70's Show is a great example. When the show came on the air, nobody really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her and I am sorry about that. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mom. She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway. This show has been a delight with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but I hope they don't stay too far away too long. I wish the show's creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, Third Rock from The Sun, is more successful on Fox than they were on NBC which sabotaged their show. The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Network: Fox; Genre: Sitcom; Content Rating: TV-PG (for language, sexual content and drug use); Perspective: Contemporary (star range: 1 - 4); Available: DVD &amp; Syndication <br><br>Season Reviewed: Complete Series (7 seasons) <br><br>Eric Forman (Topher Grace) is the skinny, geeky son of Red (Kurtwood Smith) and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp, "Seinfeld") Forman, wasting away his high school days in 1970s Point Place, Wisconsin, hanging out with burn-out friends Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), spoiled rich girl, Jackie (Mila Kunis), and Foreign Exchange Student, Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), and childhood neighbor and girlfriend Donna (Laura Prepon).<br><br>"That 70s Show" is a shaggy-dog of a sitcom and it doesn't try to hide it. Created by Bonnie &amp; Terry Turner ("3rd Rock from the Sun") and telling the semi-autobiographical story of co-creator Mark Brazill (Brazill, you are no Judd Apatow), "70s" is a simple studio audience sitcom that assembles a great cast with loads of chemistry on a stage, throws them some great one-liners, catch phrases for Red, slapstick for Kelso, classic sitcom bits (we never know Fez's name or his native country) and lets it fly off into big laughs. It doesn't want to change the world, or even be remembered in 5 years, but "70s" is a consistently funny sitcom with guaranteed laughs every time I sit down to watch.<br><br>As dumb/funny shows go, it is top-of-the-line. This thing can put together bits so intentionally and brazenly stupid the result is laugh-out-loud hysterical. A favorite includes the slapdash fantasy sequences that often come from Red or Eric. You haven't lived until you've seen a Red Forman fantasy scene. Yeah, a little relationship drama gets thrown into the mix, with the friends swapping partners at a velocity just slower than those of "Friends". But it was always kept as un-dramatic as possible with usual confrontation scenes set with the rest of the cast standing in the background commenting on it all.<br><br>"70s" works so well because the show puts all of its focus on the one thing it really needs to: the characters. Pretty much everything else can, and often does, go by the wayside if we care for these people and "70s" succeeds in giving us the feeling we are hanging out with friends (in "the circle", the show's trademark suggestion of drug use, as the case may be) that we'll want to come back to each week. If you are looking for logic in the concept you won't find it here. The show's concept of time is loose, appearing to swirl around in some generic "Saturday Night Live" sketch of the 70s. Characters have their 17th birthday and then have it again next year, they wear cloths and use technology that didn't exist in the 70s and see movies that out of the order they where released. It's a great example of how good laughs can supersede all those things.<br><br>The show looks like a free-for-all pig-pile of fun where the stories and bits are slapped together simply as an excuse for the cast to get together and laugh it up. That fun infectiously comes through the screen. Often we can see the actors nearly cracking up over their lines or snickering in the background supporting each other. It is no surprise that it has launched the careers of its stars: Ashton Kutcher has parlayed his good looks and gift for physical comedy into movies and his own show ("Punk'd"), Valderrama has parlayed his success into one hot teenage star after another and Mila Kunis has latched onto Seth MacFarlane and Seth Green and hasn't looked back.<br><br>But, for me, the biggest and most underrated performances on the show all lie in the Formans. It is a crime that the unshakable Kurtwood Smith, a funny and occasionally heart-breaking character performance from Rupp and Grace, processing a naturally perfect deadpan comic delivery, where all snubbed for Emmy nominations. Topher Grace should have a huge movie career ahead of him.<br><br>Hard-core TV fans will be familiar with Jon Hein's "Jump the Shark" concept and website  which chronologues the moment where a show hits a height of absurdity and then goes downhill. "That 70s Show" seemed hell bent on going through every single Jump the Shark moment and keep its head up. New characters showed up (Tommy Chong as you guessed it), Eric and Donna "did it", there where dramatic break-up episodes and the show even took advantage of its setting and recreated The Fonz's infamous jump over a shark, with Fez in the Fonz roll. It pushed and pushed and didn't fall, not until the very end, when it absurdly decided to give Kelso a baby with guest star Shannon Elizabeth and then suffered from the resignation of Kutcher and star Grace to pursue their own movie careers. "70s" continued for one more worthless season, even having the guts to replace Eric as Donna's love interest with Josh Meyers and abusing our belief in the show's core relationship.<br><br>My big pet peeve with "70s' is the way all the character are slaves to sex, the all-mighty. The men grovel for it, the women withhold it and put their men on a short leash. The lives of these kids are made nearly miserable (particularly Fez) by their constant pursuit to "do it". Yes, they are teenagers and teenagers are obsessed with sex, but here and they all speak with the same without a single original thought on the subject. Hearing high schoolers using phrases like "naughty places" and "fun parts" is a cringing.<br><br>A great myth making its way around, perpetuated by the Brits, is that American television is so bankrupt for ideas that it is always remaking popular British shows. While that does happen, we never hear that it also goes both ways. Case in point, "That 70s Show" was remade in the UK as a colossal failure called "Days Like These". It's true.<br><br>* * * / 4</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">in our televisions anyway. Being a fan since basically it debuted I felt it was my task to share my 2 cents on it. I think it's a given the show went downhill after Topher and Ashton left but I certainly don't think they were (what someone up thread said) 'ungrateful' for the show that started their careers. They were kids when this show began and for a show that wasn't do to last past two years (originally) having eight years under your belt is not something you can frown about. Yes, Topher and Ashton left after 7th season but they are the promising of the group and probably had scripts drop in their laps left and right so I don't blame them for wanting to move on. I also noticed that the crowd didn't cheer for either Topher or Ashton, well one Toph's scenes were pare-taped since he had to get back to NY for Spider-Man 3. As for Ashton, I'm not too sure since I wasn't at the taping. However I am proud to be a fan for as many years as I have. I'm proud of everyone that associated with the show. And my time on the set was memorable beyond my wildest dreams but we still can enjoy the show on FX and FOX for a while. Every show has to end and they did it at the right time. Because after 6th season it was going downhill but losing Topher and Ashton killed it. RIP That '70s Show. It was a groovy run! 1998-2006</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">First let me say farewell to one of the best shows in the entire universe. Secondly I was disappointed at the end. I think the ending seemed rushed. You don't even see Eric greeting his parents. Especially Kitty who is crazy about him. It was bizarre how they go from Eric and Donna kissing to them straight in the basement getting high. Don't get me wrong, getting high is the highlight of this show but I wish there was one more half hour.<br><br>And when Kelso came back the audience didn't even cheer, it was so bleak. He didn't even really seem into it, and the Topher scene was so fast, He also seemed barley interested, seemed like he wanted to get the hell out. Kelso and Topher just didn't seem into it. I think Topher and Ashton are ungrateful to the show that gave them this career I still love Donna Jackie fez and Hyde cuz they stuck through it. It sucks Jackie was passed around more then a joint in Foremans basement, but I think her and Fez getting together didn't suck. I think it was good. Fez is clingy and Jackie needs someone who will be with her forever and thats defenitley fez. I just wish it was a half hour longer. Kind of bleak and unfinished ending, so sad for a show that had started out like the 4th of July. Anyway still my favorite show, Long Live In Syndication</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">It's not very often a series comes around that everyone likes. On the surface, "That '70s Show" was pretty much a one joke vehicle, but after living my teenage years through the Seventies, I really wished these people were my friends. Granted, I never wasted my life drinking beer and antagonizing my parents, but these young actors under the surface really cared about each other when they weren't busy trying to screw and steal each other over 24/7. Topher Grace plays Eric Forman; the same kind of likable loser I was and Mila Kunis was the for whom I would have secretly had an infatuation. Masterson and Valderama had all the best lines as Forman's best friends. Only things I didn't like was that Ashton "Dude, Where's My Car" Kutcher as Michael Kelso was irritatingly annoying! (I did like him in DUDE) He was just too stupid and unbelievable and Laurie Prepon is just too ove - . Who are these people who think she's a bigger over Kunis? I don't see it! Kurtwood Smith was funny as a hesitant father and Debra Jo Rupp was just WAY over the top as the mother. She plays the role as if she were possessed by a psychotic Doris Day. Don Stark was father to Prepon's character and served as a focus of abuse by Eric's dad and amusement from Topher and his friends. Former Angel Tanya Roberts kept her head above water as the boys obsessed on her, but it was not enough and she departed. Sadly, the series' top two stars, Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher have left before the last season. It's a beginning to the end; the show just can't be expected to survive with just Kunis, Valderama and Masterson. A sad end to a once great series....</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Apart from the deliberate dating of the fashion sense, and the vintage toys, where were the 70's? This was a regular sitcom with trite and basic story lines. They attempted to make it different by saying "Hey, it's the 70's guys." <br><br>Some good jokes and nostalgic references (again, the toys and clothes) don't make it a 70's show. And since music like that gets played on current shows, I can't count that. They should have gone for rarer hits. Leo Geddes anyone? <br><br>Fez Vandaramma became a himbo due to this show. And Hyde was Leo on 'Joe's Life.' "Dick Jones" Kurtwood seemed to be channeling Peter Boyle in his role. Just a less slovenly version. And the marijuana circles got old FAST.<br><br>And did anyone else notice the main set was very similar to the Brady Bunch household?</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Ya,this show could have been pretty good.Almost all the key chars are damn good actors,but I'd say that Kurtwood Smith with "my foot in your ass" and Ashton Kutcher and his Burns were the best.I also liked Danny Masterson (Hyde) and his ironic comments at everything. Also ,that 70's atmosphere was pretty damn funny.The furniture,the bright colors,the funky clothes,the Disco feeling,all gave the 70's air.<br><br>What was bad?Something very important in my opinion:the script.The jokes were good,the situations funny,but the story was awful.They watched too much "Friends",but they couldn't match that script.The story just goes and goes,the sudden changes of heart of the girls and boys are very artificial,it just doesn't fit sometimes. I watched an interview with the cast of "Friends" and they all said the script was just very,very good,there all feels right there's nothing that seems like "Let's make one more season,the money is good". So,in conclusion,bad script,good actors,watch the seasons 1 to 7 ,the finale and the bloopers and you'll be fine, Don't go to season 8 it's dangerously bad...</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">What a great show. This show is fantastically brilliant. Most TV appeals to certain categories of audiences. this show is brilliant because it appeals to most all audiences, besides little kids, (there is some sexual and drug content). but it appeals to teens because it has stupid teen humor such as people doing stupid things and getting hurt. it also has adult humor because it shows adult life and makes it funny. for example, it is hilarious when Kitty Forman goes through menopause. And it makes it funny that red has really no heart and the war has made him cold, but it is extremely funny when he makes fun of Eric for being weak, completely unlike Red.<br><br>the characters, Eric plays red and kitties weak son who is not very good looking but gets an extremely hot girlfriend, Donna. Donna is the hot girlfriend that is the good girl. She is smart and is not all materialistic, like Jackie. Jackie, is a rich, materialistic girl who only goes out with hot guys like Michael Kelso. Kelso is an extremely dumb, but good looking guy that likes to do crazy, dumb stuff, and he plans to get through life only on his looks. Then their is Hyde. Hyde is the cool guy who always wears sunglasses and knows how to help everyone in a cool way. Fez, is the perverted, foreign guy who won't tell anyone where he is from. Kitty, the mom who babies her son and always gets upset with her husband, red. red is the war veteran who is slave to his wife but has not heart and makes really dark jokes, such as his famous, "foot in the ass" jokes. last,bob. the next door tacky neighboor who has a huge appetite and changes girlfriends all the time.<br><br>the cast all adds up to make one well-rounded, funny as hell show that i am sorry to say is not going on any longer. by the way, if you watch the new episodes, Eric and Michael kelso are gone and a guy named randy replaces them both and he is extremely funny. also, there is Leo, the stoned hippy that has no brain left. there are so many more minor characters that add to this show being the greatest show of all time.</div>

I originally heard it was supposed to be canceled sometime this year, but now there's nothing indicating that that will happen. I'm confused. Is it going to be canceled or not? I like Hyde and Donna, but I find Jackie to be too whiny, I like Kelso's dumb witted humor, and Fez's observations of people and things around him. As for Eric, I wish he'd get off his butt and actually go do something with his life. But if I had to pick my number one favorite character, I'd have to say it would be Leo. I am just wondering what they're going to do with this show once Eric and Kelso are gone.</div>

I hope the show is as great as it has been. Every show had new laughs and great story lines. It's a classic about classic times. The characters are great and the actors perfectly fit their characters. There is talent all around and the all the guest stars complement the show every time. You have to admit that Kitty Forman is hilarious. She is the mom everyone would want even in her all too familiar drunken state. Red Forman reminds me of the younger version of my grumpy grandfather. You cannot help but love him even if a foot is stuck in your a**.There is never a dull moment and it is great to watch the reruns...for the fifth and sixth time. The show depicts the era perfectly. I feel the best episode is the wresting match. You cannot go back to the 70s better than that. Awesome show!!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I think this show is great. Who cares if it's not that accurate or every teeny tiny detail isn't right, its a TV show and it's meant to be enjoyed for what it is. I was born in 85, so I wouldn't notice the inconsistencies anyway. <br><br>I, being a rather avid writer myself, like shows that have witty or smart humor. That's why I absolutely loathe reality shows. Note: To everyone who hates this show, at least it's ORIGINAL and not the crap we're given to watch every single night of the week on every damn station that it SO unrealistic and unflattering to thinking people. (Reality Shows)"That 70's Show" is smart if you listen to the characters words or understand what the jokes really mean, rather than judging the show by what each actor looks like or who they're playing. <br><br>A note on those characters: They're characters!! Ashton isn't that dumb, and I think he's rather good as Kelso. Though Kelso isn't the type I would normally hang out with, he's a great comic relief.However, Hyde is my absolute fav. Why? I'm not sure. I enjoy his intense scrutiny of the government, because I share that trait myself.I just think he is so well played and his cocky humor gets me going every time. All the other characters are great, especially FEZ. It IS spelled that way, because it has been said that the "Z" is poetic license. Major compliments should go out to Red and Kitty. Is there a better laugh on TV? I think not. By the way, who really gives two shoves if they haven't won EMMY's? These award shows are so fake today, it really doesn't signify true brilliance in the art of theater anymore if you ask me. (EX: Titanic was a piece of over-rated junk that ruined Dicaprio's promising career and it won like, 11 Oscars or something right?)The fact that "That 70's Show" has gained a loyal, cult following proves to these actors that they don't need statues to prove their abilities to anyone. <br><br>The issue of drugs: OK, first off, way more people do them than will admit it. I think it's a way to amp up the stereotype that the 70's rained pot seeds instead of precipitation. Get over it. Viewers aren't that fanatical when it's suggested that if they see Hyde or Eric do it, they'd jump out of their seats and run to the nearest dealer. People are able to think for themselves. <br><br>The Feminism issue: Guys, get over yourselves. We're smarter, end of story. You will always succumb to the powers (breasts, looks, lack of ability to think for themselves that SOME possess) of women and I highly doubt that this sitcom is directed at females. There are 4 males and 2 females. It just gets me when every time there is a strong female lead, Donna, male viewers get themselves all in a huff. I don't give a wretch about feminism or all that hype; I think chicks treat men poorly too. IE: Jackie to Kelso. She needs a punch. I just don't think it's a conspiracy. :o)<br><br>Finally, to expand on the title of my one line summary, even my mom watches it. She's and oldie, born in 57, but a goodie. LOL. Point being, she laughs when I laugh and that says something, at least to me. We don't have popcorn and pillow fight parties or anything on Wednesday nights, but if it's on re-runs during the day, and I'm watching, she'll stop whatever she's doing and have a look or laugh out loud if she hears it from the other room.<br><br>I'm a big fan and I hope seasons 2-7 get released on DVD. Good Day! (pun intended)</div>

It was "Jan 13th 1977, Eric Forman's Garage" It was the night before I went to the Air Force. It was a great show from the start with the fads, the fashions and the cars from my youth. Red sounds like the father of a friend of mine. I really like the stoner scenes in the basement</div>

However, they continue to make us laugh, and until they stop doing so, it will be a great show to watch.</div>

Growing up as a teenager in the seventies I thought it was because I could really relate, but I have a twelve year son who watches it with me and he also enjoys it. In fact he started watching it before I did. I guess everyone has a sort of facination with the seventies. My favorite character is Tommy Chong as Leo. Although he wasn't on that often, the episodes with him are my favorite. I'm really going to miss him. I really like the way they have so many guest stars that where popular in the 70's. What I think makes this show great is that that's how it was. Just hanging out with friends. Listening to music and watching the TV with no sound. There is just on thing that bothers me. Would somebody please, please tell me what happened to Donna's kid sister Tina? Does anyone remember that episode? Did they put her in so that could follow suit of other 70's sitcomes and just have her disappear without any trace or explaination? If anybody knows, please tell me.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70's Show does what is is intended to do.  It makes people laugh. Those of us who remember growing up in the seventies laugh because we recognize the clothes, the behavior, the parents, and the decor. We laugh because we get the references made in the fantasy sequences. We laugh at what seemed so very serious and important back in the day.  And we laugh because we grew up on true situation comedy, and understand that it is not there to teach us, guide us, enlighten us, or empower us.  It exists to make us laugh.  Against that yardstick, That 70's Show measures up beautifully.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Why are so many people into That '70s Show? Even people who weren't around in 1977? And why was That '80s Show so incredibly bad? "70s" is so funny, not only because it's developed these characters that are either grounded/well-rounded or great comic foils, but also because it puts its characters in situations they find really uncomfortable, then lets them engage in these surreal fantasy  sequences that are incredibly funny--Fez's infamous "shark jump" a la the Fonz to compete with new student Tomas, Eric vs. Alice Cooper at Donna's radio station, Kitty's nightmare with 'baby' Eric ("I'd rather have sex... with Donna"), the Star Wars episode ("Jedi Knight--pffft---Jedi DUMBASS!"), Donna worrying about Eric and other women ("Panties! GLORIOUS panties!") Plus, they've got those great TV shows and movies from the '70s, cheesy as they were, that they can parody, and have on many occasions (The Six Million Dollar Man, Charlie's Angels, Annie Hall). Too bad more shows don't take those kinds of chances...Even That '80s Show, but what could they have done? Parodies of Dynasty and Dallas or the Cosby Show or Die Hard? (Yawn!) Plus, the comic ability of the cast (particularly Topher Grace (Eric), Danny Masterson (Hyde), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and Ashton Kutcher (Kelso)) is greater than that of only a handful, and probably any show I've seen since NewsRadio. They all have their key strengths at which they all excel. The 360 shot (aka "The Circle") is a genius comic device, albeit one that really takes the right lines to work at its best. I just hope the fictional town of Point Place isn't too far from the University of Wisconsin at Madison so this show can be hilarious for a long while...</div>

The cast just all totally works together, the jokes always deliver.  I can't enough about how much I have come to love this show.  One of the best parts is of course Kurtwood Smith.  The Red Foreman character is one of the best in all of sitcom history.  I know a lot of people who can say he reminds him of their own father.  Best show on network TV by far.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Just an assurance to the young cast that their talents do not go unnoticed or unappreciated by their dry-humored, cult audience.  What is amazing is that every member of this ensemble cast is perfect, and each character has been allowed some depth to probe their range as actors.  So many great moments (except, of course, for most of season one and the god-awful musical episode!), such as chocolate super-lax, Eric as Steven Tyler, Hot Donna, the ingenious stoner cam, the addition of Caroline as nemesis.  Kurtwood Smith would make Archie Bunker proud, as the long-suffering, "dumbass"-spewing dad Red Forman, and Debra Jo Rupp has found her comedic zenith as his snappy, righteous wife.  Topher Grace, as evidenced also in Traffic, is a phenomenal talent.  Laura Prepon shows great emotional range and real presence as Donna.  Mila Kunis is both completely annoying and sweetly endearing as Jackie Burkhardt.  Every one of the main characters hold equal weight as anchors, only ... whatever happened to the actresses playing Midge and Lori? I understand the departures on the show, but they're so brilliant in their respective ditziness and evil.  Bring 'em back before this next/last? season ends.  Give Pointe Place a graduation and let these great young actors go on and thrive.  Thank God for syndication!</div>

I remember it all...the hideous clothes, the feathered hair, the bad afro that Donna's father sports (my dad had the exact same 'do).  I had older cousins that lived near me that were around the same ages of the characters and some of the conversation they had are said almost word for word on the show...that is scary.  I never really thought I'd be at an age where my childhood is something I can review once a week at the Foreman household, but it is.  If your a card carrying member of the dreaded Gen-X, this show is for you.  If you came along later, you may end up lost.  Either way, it's a great show.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Wow!  Having graduated from high school in '71 I can identify with this show and testify that the parody is pretty much right on.  I swear I knew every one of these characters when I was in my teens and early 20's.  And characters they are.  Each one has  a completely unique personality, yet they are all true to life.<br><br>Another thing I like about this show is that all the humor does not revolve around sexual inuendo, as almost every other show on TV does nowadays.  I have nothing against sexual inuendo, but geez!  When EVERY show revolves around the same theme, when every show has the same punchlines over and over it really gets old.  What we have here is a little originality, and it is soooo refreshing.<br><br>And the pot-smoking?  Hey, how could you do a show about the '70s without it?  I'll bet 90% of the people I knew back then got high.  There are worse things to glorify.  Like all the violence on TV, for instance.  With all the drugs, long hair, protests, and hippies, the '70s were STILL a much better era to live in.  Why?  Much less violence, much more idealism.  Unless you count Vietnam, but hey; that was government-sponsored violence, and a government-sponsored reality check, so who's to argue?</div>

Now starting their 2nd season, they have really pulled out all the stains and made this show a delight! I love the humor and Kurtwood Smith (Red) is an awesome actor (Might I add a sweet guy!)<br><br>I also was lucky enough to see it live in August and I have to say it was the best taping I've been to, SO FAR!  What I absolutely love is the facial expressions of Topher Grace (Eric Forman) he really has a gift!  He's a great actor and I can see this kid going places.  Great job of reliving the 70s.  Now let's see if we can carry on to the 80s!<br><br>THANK YOU FOX for this great show!</div>

It is just so well done.<br><br>I especially love the rotating camera sequences that are shown when the characters are having a conversation.

I wasn't struggling with high school any more and wasn't worrying about children (at least until 1977).  We had so much fun.  This series will give the 70s the credit the decade deserves--it was always passed over as being fairly inconsequential, except for the Bi-centennial.<br><br>Everyone in the cast is great, even, to a certain extent, Tanya Roberts, of whom I was never fond. The younger people play off each other with great timing--you'd think they'd been with each other for years.  And the adults are a scream, as well.  My husband and I injure ourselves laughing, especially the "rolling background" scenes; maybe it's because we remember it that way!  Anyway, although our youngest (age 14) calls us a couple of "dinosaurs", it won't stop us from loving this show.  In our opinion, it's the best this new season.  Long may it (and the 70s) live!</div>

The concept is great, but content means nothing without clever writing, and the writing on this one is spot on.  All the actors are great, with Kurtwood Smith (Red) as the standout.  He has been stuck in cheesy movies all his career, usually cast as a Heavy or a Villian.  It is good to see him break out of his typecasting and perfom comedy.  Bravo.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">No matter what people say, this is a good show: good acting, good filming, good story.  I especially like the rotating camera shots in the basement with the "mysterious" smoke surrounding the teenagers.  It's unfortunate that in recent episodes there have not been as many of these scenes.<br><br>The acting is solid, Masterson especially (I'll always remember him as the boyfriend in Face/Off who gets the crap beaten out of him).  The adult roles are also well-done, Forman's father Red especially. He has some hilarious lines: "What are you going to write on your resume: dumbass?"<br><br>When Forman is asked if he is smoking pot: Kitty: There's clinics, therapy, groups..... Red: My foot kicking your ass.<br><br>Though this will never be as good as the show that comes before, "The Simpsons," it is still original, and I hope that this fall they return it the spot directly after the Simpsons.  It's kind of nice to follow an animated show with a regular sitcom rather than "Futurama."</div>

Beer cans still had PULL TABS back then (Red is clearly seen opening a beer that has a pull up/push down thing like they do now).<br><br>Fes is the character's name, NOT FEZ.

The Ski trip to Alpine Valley, the Disco in Kenosha, "God, would it kill you to let the Packers have a winning season?"

                <div class="text show-more__control">FOX is a gambling network. They take plenty of risks with new shows. Sometimes those risks pay off, other times the shows bomb big time. This show is wonderful - a hit - and I think it is safe to consider it the best new show of the season. The cast is superb and the stories are funny...but the humor isn't forced. It's a show that is fun to watch and easy to enjoy.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">No offense, Fox, but your promotions for this show really turned me off. Then I found out that Mila Kunis was in this show and of course we have to watch anything with Mila Kunis in it. Actually, that's not entirely true, but I'll continue by saying I LOVE THIS SHOW! This show is my life and I can't wait until it returns for its second season. It's about Eric Forman (Topher Grace) and all his teenager friends ranging in age from roughly 15 to seniors and juniors in high school. It is rumored that one of the characters, Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson) is not really a teenager at all but has just been held back in school. (We know he has to be under 21 because in the episode "Career Day" his mom wants to buy him a beer and asks, "Do you have your fake identity?") I think this show somewhat accurately portrays teenage lives from the '70s but who cares if it's accurate 'cause it's such a darn good show!! I did notice an inaccuracy, though; the show starts in '76 and I hear one of the characters was wearing toe socks for it but toe socks weren't invented until '77! Aw, who really needs to know this? I'm just a thirteen-year-old girl who loves That '70s Show. I recommend you watch it if you're bored some Sunday at 8:30 PM ET. Just turn it to Fox and you'll get some laughs. Of course, the show is on hiatus right now and will return in June. The season finale just aired, people. It was kind of sad. Donna sort of "unofficially broke up" with Eric. :-( Not that I care about that, it's just that that part was kind of sad. Well, anyway, this message is really long so I just wanna say, PLEEEEAAAASSSEEE WATCH THAT '70S SHOW SO WE CAN ASSURE THE FACT THAT IT WILL HAVE A LONG, HAPPY, RUN, OK? OK. Thanks for listening.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I love this show. It is one of maybe three or four non-animated comedy shows that I actually watch. People can complain that it wasn't what the 70s were really like. I say, who cares? The show never ceases to be entertaining and the characters are all very well defined. I really care about what happens to them. In fact, nerdy, bumbling Eric is so much like me, I often have to wince even while I'm cracking up. The best thing about the show is that it is unafraid to completely disregard reality and go on weird flights of fancy, like the time Eric's mom had a dream sequence in which his friends were either pimps or hookers forcing her perfect little angel to break the rules.<br><br>Unfortunately, Fox has yanked the show due to low ratings, meaning that they now have a grand total of zero live-action comedies on their schedule. They say that it will be back next season and they better not be pulling our legs. This show deserves as big an audience as it can get. Maybe the title scares people off-- "That 70s Show" seems to imply half an hour of jokes about tie-dyeing. Give this show a chance when it comes back in the summer. I can almost guarantee you'll like it.</div>

Ok, into the review.......  Wonderfully written, wonderfully acted, wonderfully casted... At first I loved all the characters, short of Kitty (Eric's mom), Jacquie, and Donna's parents, but I've since developed an appreciation for them (and a love for Mrs Foreman, and Jacquie)....  I've taped all of the show to date, short of the second episode...  Fez rules, Hyde rules, Donna rules, Red Foreman rules, Eric rules, need I go on?   And I don't care if the 70 were never like this -- were the 50s ever as portrayed on Happy Days? Good acting and good writing is rare on TV these days, and this show has both in spades....</div>

His timing and grasp of character (Eric Foreman) are both nearly perfect.  All rest of the cast are great as a supporting team.

And several recurring ideas make the show a thrill to watch.  The rotating camera during a conversation is great.  And I wonder if some of those scenes were scripted.

Topher Grace wanted to leave, and they had to work around sending Eric to Africa, Kelso as a cop, Hyde as a black guy(LOL), Fez's homosexual styles, jewelry store nemesis, and unbelievable winning of Jackie, Kelso and his baby mama drama, and the terrible new characters that had to be forcibly written in like Josh Meyers from Mad TV. I like him on Mad TV, just not as a replacement for Eric. That was horribly done. <br><br>The show was so different by season 8, that you may not even recognize it from season 1-4. It had to rely much more on new characters running a record store, and missing original cast members, and Fez/Kelso renting an apartment, etc. that the whole feel of the show is gone by the last couple of seasons. Seasons 1-5 are a 9 or 10, the last seasons were more of a 4, but I watched to the end, because I grew up with this show, and still get a ton of laughs from many episodes.<br><br>Another thing that hurt the show was the drug abuse and crazy behavior of the actress playing Eric's sister, who brought a lot of funny scenes in her role as Eric's nemesis, Kelso's temptress, and the town whore who was still the apple of daddy's eye. The actress playing her ended up living out of a car upon leaving, from what I heard. Unfortunate... <br><br>Many great supporting characters made the show great, and the music was cool.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">(may or may not contain spoilers) one time on a vacation i didn't have anything to do so my mom had me watch episode 1, i loved it. i can relate to a lot of the characters (especially Fez and Kelso) and find them all lovable in some way. the show relies on crude, stupid and slapstic humor but is absolutely hilarious. my favorite character is Leo (the stoner dude who has me on the floor laughing). this show has me dying of laughter all of the time and it never gets old. and it also has a good sense of emotion (Donna and Erics first breakup had me in tears lol), and also knows how to make you laugh seconds later.<br><br>tip: if your going to watch it, i'd recommend binge watching because the longer you watch it for the funnier it gets (for me at least)</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control">"Friends" (which is hilarious) has a much broader audience than this show, so I can understand why "That '70s Show" has a lower rating. If you are turned off by a bunch of high school kids smoking pot in the '70s, you will not take the time to watch it, and you will give it a low rating. If this element does not bother you, you will start on the first episode and never quit watching it; from the beginning you will know the jokes in this show are MUCH MUCH MUCH funnier than the humor used in the widely acclaimed highly-rated sitcom "Friends." Friends is hysterical, but this show is nothing like Friends. Yes it has an over-used laugh track, and over dramatic humor. But the humor and the jokes are the not same, nor nearly as funny as in That '70s Show. Although it makes me laugh-out-loud, Friends focuses more on the drama and storyline rather than making the audience laugh. AND, personally I like the drama and storyline in that 70's show MUCH more; even though they put more of their time into making the audience laugh. Friends will always be hilarious, but That '70s Show will always make it seem weak.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70s show is probably the 2nd best sitcom on TV ever and the most underrated sitcom as well. I believe they have captured the essence of the 70s in this show perfectly. A lot less technologically advanced era ruled by pranks and kids doing stupid stuff. I can never explain how brilliant and how funny this show is. I've absolutely memorized every word of every episode since i kept watching every episode over and over again. There hasn't been a single time when I felt that it doesn't make me laugh anymore. The show absolutely makes me want to live in the 70s with goofy friends like that. That's the greatest success for the show. It makes you want to be there and be like that. Simplicity is its strength. All in all, If not for FRIENDS, I'd have regarded this one as the best ever Sitcom. It's the only thing that comes to being as funny as FRIENDS really. Kudos to each one of the cast and crew. DON'T MISS IT!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This is one of the most truly intelligent, accurate, funniest and greatest sitcom to ever show on TV. In addition to these rare characteristics it also has a mildly designed level of political statements. It is constantly re-running here in Israel, and both me and my 2 teen boys see it as classic, the more you see it - the more you enrich and profit. It has numerous levels to explore. It's ART. I am shocked over and over again when I review various staging and ratings of TV shows only to learn that for some reason it was and still is not placed amongst the greatest sitcoms, ever, as NUMBER 2 (after Seinfeld) where it truly belongs. True - Season 8 was problematic, but Topher Grace, Danny Masterson, Debra Jo Rupp, Wilder Valderamma, Kurtwood Smith, Don Starks, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Laura Prepon, Tanya Roberts, Tommy Chong and the entire crew are great in a true classic way, with expressions, texts ans ability to act, which are among the greatest TV moments. You can listen and see them over and over and over again. Something in the rating is not right. Maybe even not honest. I hope one day soon the show will air again as That post 70's Show with the same cast and that TV rating will do it Just. Thank you Dorit</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Let's start by saying it's just one of the greatest sitcoms i've ever seen. It has all the characters a comedy show must have. A beautiful girl in the name of Mila Kunis, a dumb guy in the name of Ashton Kutcher and the creepy foreign guy in the name of Wilmer Valderrama. It's also like the normal setting in a sitcom. Put all the characters in a same room (in this case the basement) and let them have funny adventures. <br><br>The difficult part is to make it funny all the time and that's what this show does perfectly. Mostly i like the performance of Ashton Kutcher, he's just absolutely brilliant! <br><br>I have to say i didn't like season 8 as much as the other seasons,although it's still great! The reason is that Kelso and Eric are gone the most of the time, probably the 2 most funny people in the show.<br><br>It's also a show that makes you want to watch the next episode all the time. It's compelling, funny and has a great story behind it too. I wish there were more shows like this one.</div>

I'm not a 70's kid, but the show makes me want to go back and live in that era. One of my favorite episodes is when Kelso calls the president and says that the president is in danger, but doesn't say from who or what, so the gang thinks they are being staked out by the FBI and get really paranoid. As great as I think this show is, there is one thing that troubles me about it...season seven had a lot from '79, even Christmas of '79, yet season eight happened with a Valentine's day and even ANOTHER Christmas which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something, but other than that odd overlook, it is a great show, "That 70's Finale" was sad to watch.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I'll start this review by saying, I have become a big fan of That 70s Show. Ever since I met the occupants of Point Place in the pilot, I've become avid in following these characters lives throughout all eight seasons. The writing is pitch-perfect, with almost every joke coming off solidly and every character so three-dimensional you feel like you've been welcomed into a group of friends.<br><br>Whilst the show does occasionally have a duff season, four was my personal least favourite and many despise eight, this is one the few American TV Shows which did not grow stale on me. I always came back for more. Which, overall, is the aim of all sitcoms.<br><br>The premise is simple. Eric Forman is a somewhat lazy, dry-humoured slacker who lives with his fussing mother, Kitty, hard-ass father, Red and promiscuous sister, Laurie. Next door resides the object of Eric's desires, Donna Pinciotti, as well as her dopey yet quirky parents Bob and Midge. Eric attempts to woo his next door neighbour whilst dealing with the misadventures of his friends the absent-minded Michael Kelso, rebellious Steven Hyde, perverted Fez and spoilt Jackie Burkhart. Oh, and also, it's set in the '70s.<br><br>Highlights of the show include Topher Grace's perfect portrayal of Eric Forman, managing to create one of the most likable characters ever to appear on a TV screen. Even if he makes stupid, selfish decisions, you still find yourself rooting for the boy, which proves Grace's ability. Showing quick wit and charm, he is clearly the break-our character for me, though everyone has their favourites. Along with this we have Ashton Kutcher's role as Michael Kelso, a character he seems to take with him with every acting job he's achieved since That 70s Show. Kutcher's comic timing and improvisation is barred by none and he offers a slap-stick side to the show, a void they fail to fill after Kutcher left during Season 8. Wilmer Valderrama and Laura Prepon are also worthy mentions, both being equally funny and natural in their performances.<br><br>A lot dislike the finale season, due to the absences of Grace and Kutcher as well as the new character, Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers. However, I choose to disagree. Grace and Kutcher's characters were written out in such ways that I felt their characters stories had come to an end. I no longer felt a necessity to see these characters. Sure, I certainly wanted to, but I felt their endings to be heart-warming and, above all, within character. But, I still wanted to see what became of the other characters which, of course, are why I picked up Season 8. In regards to Randy, Meyers is funny. I found myself laughing at a majority of his jokes, and he offered something fresh within the shows structure. It was nice seeing the old characters interact with the new. His entrance may have felt a little forced, but overall, what he offered was pretty decent. The finale episode in itself was spectacular, though I wish there could have been a little more loose ends tied up. However, that's something left in hopes of any spin - offs in the near future.<br><br>As a show, That 70s Show is one of the most consistent in laughs on telly. Smart, witty and so lovable, everyone will find someone or something to love in a show like this.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I started watching that 70's show just last year and it did became one of my favorite shows because this is one of few sitcoms where teenagers are the main focus and i can relate to that . At first it may sound that there are not many laughs but gradually as we keep watching it becomes more and more funnier with each passing episode like for instance Red uses the word dumb ass a lot as a first time viewer you may not laugh but after multiple viewings it is really funny. There are six teenagers Eric,Donna,Hyde,Kelso,Jackie and Fez all of them are equally funny as each other though everyone will have their own favorites and they are supported well by Red ,Kitty,Bob and Leo.They all hangout in Eric's basement which is as famous as the characters of the show .They deal with usual teenage problems like sex ,drugs ,parents relationships etc . Now i will describe the characters briefly Eric- He is a normal teenager somewhat a little stupid who thinks he is the coolest guy which he is not .His character has a great sense of humor.The conflicts between him and red are really hilarious Donna - She is Eric's neighbour who had a relationship with Eric.She is not the normal type of girl a little bit on the tougher side .She is tall and there are many jokes about her height which never get old Hyde-He is the cool guy in the show .He never really cares about anything and teaches most of the gang about how to deal with problems.He never expresses his feelings or problems Kelso- He is a guy who thinks he is the most good looking guy in the world and can get anybody which he is but he cannot back up his good looks with intelligence as most of the times he is seen doing stupid things and there are often jokes by the other members of the gang of his stupidity Fez-He is the foreign kid who we really do not get to know from which country he is. He looks up to Hyde and Hyde teaches him most of the things about American culture and girls. The culture difference that he encounters and how he deals with it leads to many laughs and his accent is cool to considering he is a American. Jackie- She is a beautiful girl who often makes fun of Donna of her shortcomings .She is obsessed with her beauty especially her hair.She is also kind of somewhat seen as stupid .She also thinks that she is the prettiest girl in the world . She was in a relationship with Kelso and that relationship surely brought out a lot of laughs. All in All it is fun show to watch .It is up there with the likes of how i met your mother and friends .Though sometimes i feel it is underrated. Ashton and Mila made out big from this show maybe it was because of their looks that was made fun of in the show well it is not funny for the other cast now is it though they were all equally talented they were somewhat typecast in their roles and the audience could not look beyond that while watching them in movies.</div>

In my opinion they are all hilarious in their own way . if you're a teenager in high school like I am this show will really speak to you like it has to me. <br><br>Every episode is better than the one before it and the humor is consistent and (most importantly), relateable as well! The storyline is great. The acting is believable and realistic. You feel like you're a part of the gang every time you watch! Don't you wish you were down in that basement too??? You'll laugh you'll cry and at the end of the day you'll definitely fall In love with this show. Only one other word besides awesome can describe this show... Genius.... Just pure genius.</div>

But I found myself cringing a little every time I heard that heinous artificial laughter echoing out of my TV screen. I think if I could change one thing about this show, it would be the laugh track. Other than that, it's excellent. Very entertaining. I give it a 9, maybe even a 9.5 out of ten. But with me, that laugh track is going to cost you at least a half a point.</div>

That may not seem like a good thing, but it is. Topher Grace, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon and Mila Kunis created believable characters we all grow to love as the story progresses.<br><br>Actors emanate with humor even in simple dialogs. You can clearly see the powerful chemistry between them and that they really are friends in real life. Writers keep the humor simple, yet brilliant and surprising.<br><br>After you watch the finale I can guarantee you will feel like you are losing your dear friends.<br><br>To sum up: the only sad thing about That '70s Show is the fact that this show ended.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Gifted Actors plus a Great Line of Scripts Equals a Very Entertaining and Endearing TV Show.<br><br>From the creative process of Carsey-Warner/ Terry &amp; Bonnie Turner/Brazill comes this delightful and heartfelt romp through the mid to late 1970's through the lives of some very identifiable and highly embraceable characters.<br><br>Eric Forman (Topher Grace) embodies the boy next door with high expectations and complete vulnerabilities of the boy who needs to grow.<br><br>Totally in Love with Donna, but he sometimes lets his brain get in the way. <br><br>Donna Pinciotti(Laura Prepon) is the perfect girl next door who embraces pro-feminist beliefs, and wants a career to call her own, along with Eric, her true love. <br><br>In real life knockout gorgeous, just stay away from Karla.<br><br>Steven Hyde(Danny Masterson) Eric's best friend and semi-orphan, whose streetwise views on society are skewed due to a dysfunctional family history, and his affection to smoke reefers.<br><br>Jackie Burkhardt(Mila Kunis) is the very pretty rich/spoiled local girl whose views about life aren't realistic and border on narcissistic hedonism.<br><br>In real life, just as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside.<br><br>Fez/Foreign Exchange Student(Wilmer Valderrama) is the imported kid who struggles with the English language and acceptance with American teenage society and values. <br><br>He plays this role brilliantly. Often understated but with great timing and much affection. Classic ! Excellent dancer !<br><br>Michael Kelso(Ashton Kutcher) is the pretty boy/pollinator, who is never alone but sometimes lonely. More often a victim of his good looks, he fails to capitalize on the use of brainpower, and succumbs to female charms, much too easily.<br><br>Reginald Albert"Red" Forman(Kurtwood Smith) Eric's stern and strict father, whose Psyche was damaged due to his service in 2 major wars.<br><br>Trivia , Smith was born in 1943 in Wisconsin, the only Actor in the series to actually have come from the state here the series takes place and ineligible for either WW II or the Korean War. <br><br>Also, killed Robocop in the original film, quite a contrast from the father figure.<br><br>Katherine Anne "Kitty" Forman(Debra Jo Rupp) whose Classic portrayal of the 70's Mother has enshrined her place in History as one of the Top TV Mother's of All time. Perky, energetic, and caring/loving are her Hallmarks, testimony of her devotion to her family. Maiden name Sigurdson.<br><br>Bob Pinciotti(Don Stark)next door neighbor whose open marriage and liberal ways open him to several bizarre situations, including divorce and other failed relationships.<br><br>Midge Pinciotti(Tanya Roberts) married/divorced to Bob. Somewhat of an airhead , good-natured but her lack of discipline dooms her to failed relationships.<br><br>Laurie Forman(Lisa Robin Kelly) 22 episodes/(Christina Moore) 6 episodes. Eric's adversarial/confrontational sister whose views on sex are casual at best.<br><br>Leo(Tommy Chong) owner of the local Foto-Hut chain, doper with extreme short term memory loss, but has redeeming social value. Friends to the 70's gang.<br><br>So there you have it, great characters with complex personalities dot, Point Place , Wisconsin, with an originality seldom seen.<br><br>There is a Warren Ferguson of That 70's Show, Randy Pearson(Josh Meyers), but his plastic personality and less than inspiring presence doom him to TV Trivia Hell... than While the kids do smoke dope, hopefully there were no long term effects and they transcend their fallibility's.<br><br>Highly recommended , very watchable and addictive. <br><br>Many other talented Actors also guested, but too numerous to list. <br><br>Trivia, Terry Hughes directed only the pilot episode. David Trainer directed ALL of the rest of the series.<br><br>BTW, laying on top of the hood of a Vista Cruiser, is NOT comfortable at all, so when you see the actors on it, it is not pleasant... <br><br>The last season was a throw away,the actors stretching their roles way beyond their limits and only the last episode resolving the return of Eric/Donna's relationship. Otherwise it would have gotten a 10. Highly Addictive ! One word, "Rainbow!"</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This was the funniest show ever made. It was consistently funny, and all the actors and actresses were perfect for their roles. I have all seasons on DVD, and can watch them everyday without it ever getting old. Simply put, this was the greatest TV show of all time. The show centers around 6 teenagers and their lives growing up in Point Place, Wisconsin. This show is also great because there is no main character. All characters are equally important. Michael Kelso is played by Ashton Kutcher, Eric Forman is played by Topher Grace, Jackie Burkhart by Mila Kunis, Dona Pinciotti by Laura Prepon, Fez by Wilmer Valderramma, Hyde by Danny Masterson, Red by Kurtwood Smith, Kitty by Debra Jo Rupp, and Bob by Don Stark.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Like the characters in this show, I too was a teen during the 70s. The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. The 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this show.<br><br>The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, who all mesh together very well on camera. I really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequences. No other show does camera tricks like this. These cutting-edge film sequences, really help to convey the campy hipness, that characterized the 70s era.<br><br>Overall this is a very funny sitcom. The one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs. In this way, I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children. While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of That 70s show, keep trying to imitate it. <br><br>I do recommend That 70s Show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor. It could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">In what is a truly diverse cast, this show hits it's stride on FOX. It is the kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you just watch 1 show you might not like it much, but once you watch two or three- you get hooked.<br><br>This is because some of the jokes hit &amp; some miss depending upon how you view them. As is usual today, the themes are very mature. The humor is usually very mature too. Often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones.<br><br>Red (Kurtwood Smith) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of the "kids" is very good too. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead (who got the idea of making her a blonde?). She shows very good talent &amp; comedic timing often. She looks good without make up too.<br><br>This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom department &amp; it's most successful live action one since Married With Children</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Let's face it: the final season (#8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever enjoyed (mostly, I've never found dry spells to last a whole season). But if you judge this show by the last season, of course it's going to come across as inferior. That is an entirely unfair assessment-- because "That '70s Show" was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there weren't so different than we are here in modern times.<br><br>All right... ignoring Season 8.<br><br>Topher Grace stars as Eric Forman, a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next door. Playing their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best one is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get. What country is he from? Try to figure it out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, as Kitty, is both formidable and sweet, sort of like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna's parents, the chauvinistic but likable Bob and the airheaded Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure to Hyde.<br><br>Apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come (and that deplorable final season), "'70s" is a terrific show with amazing writing, spot-on direction, and a feel-good vibe pulsing through every episode. They're all alright.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Rated TV-14 for Language and Sex and Drug Content.<br><br>I have been watching "That 70's Show" for at least five years now.its a very hilarious and entertaining show and it boosted the careers of Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.The show takes place in the 1970's(between 1976 and 1979 to be exact) and it basically shows the misadventures of a teenager named Eric Foreman(Topher Grace) and his friends Donna,Jackie,Kelso,Hyde and Fez.All the characters in the show are hilarious.There are also a bunch of other funny characters such as Eric's father Red.That 70's Show also shows life in the 1970's such as the movies and the music.That 70's show is finished now and the series finale was good.Overall a great show!</div>

<a href="/review/rw1673245/?ref_=tt_urv" class="title"> Why I Love That 70s Show
</a>            <div class="display-name-date">
                    <span class="display-name-link"><a href="/user/ur10470951/?ref_=tt_urv">XXpyroXX</a></span><span class="review-date">12 June 2007</span>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">That '70s Show is probably my favorite television show of all time. I've been a huge fan since I was six years old. It's different from most other sitcoms, all it's characters are likable, and it has episodes that are actually original ideas, instead of recycling some of those extremely overused story lines other shows have. While the characters aren't exactly good role models and the story lines don't always teach a good lesson, there's always laughs and every episodes leaves you with a feeling of contentment and happiness. Then again, it's realistic, because unlike many shows, not every episode (or even season) has a happy ending. That '70s Show is obviously first and foremost a comedy, but it also throws in elements of drama to even it out. Real life isn't always funny or serious, but a mixture of both, and this show gives the best of both worlds. The characters all have their assets and failings, and they all have the things that make them funny, the things that make them annoying, and the things that make us love them. While this show deals with the good parts of life, such as holidays, birthdays, dating, and friendship, it also deals with life's negatives. It touches on heartbreak, parental abandonment, friendship problems, and relationship issues. This is a truly great show, because of the characters, the stories, the realism, and the way it makes you feel. Sure, it underhandedly (and possibly accidentally) supports drugs, alcohol, and underage sex, but the show is amazing and full of heart. As a teenager, I feel I can relate to a lot of the situations, much more then I could when I was six, and these characters honestly are awesome. It's a great show, so watch it!</div>

Kelso was a little exaggerated.There isn't a man that stupid. But the two girls (Donna and Jacky) were just perfect.The two girls are super hot and specially Jacky.Hyde was just the perfect bad ass.Leo the perfect hippie.

                <div class="text show-more__control">one of the best shows ever made. to me its just 8 seasons of real characters that we can all relate to. Its real life problems and pain and they do a good job of recreating the 70's. I've seen a lot of sitcoms and most of them are just OK. that 70's show is funny sad and everything in between. The two main characters Donna and Eric (Topher Grace and Laura Prepon) make the whole thing work with their relationship and everything else just falls into place Danny Masterson Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer are so great. What makes the whole show great is over the seasons the characters actually grow and get older together. From high school to being adults, and the way the show ends just put the icing on the cake That 70's Show i rate it 15 out of 10</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This sitcom is one of the funniest and most clever there is out there. It would have been, to me, my all time favorite show if it hadn't been for the final season, season 8. Season 8 was just awful. Thew new characters were nothing compared to Topher Grace's character (who was the lead character, meaning when he left the show, the show didn't have a main character anymore) and Ashton Kutcher's. Also the plot for the last season was weak, and the humor just fell through. The show should've ended after season seven. But besides season 8, which we can all just pretend didn't happen, this show is seriously full of laughs and quick wit. so, groovy man</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Now I feel that this show was one of the better ones on TV. Even though the characters can be bitter toward each other at times, the creators of the show scripted it in a way that makes it funny and entertaining, rather than outright bothersome and annoying. Each and every one of the characters are funny to watch, and it's funny to see them get involved in some sort of misfortune. Unlike many shows today, the creators of this one knew how to take elements of comedy and use them correctly. I'm pleased to see that there's at least a few good recently-made shows that are still on TV. Indeed, I enjoy watching this show and like all the characters and episodes. It's a very enjoyable show and refreshing from much of the crap they air now. I would definitely recommend this show, although I would recommend it for more a mature audience, rather than for little kids, as the content is too raw for children to be exposed to.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Man, where to begin? The very first episode entitled "That 70s Pilot" was the one that started it all back in 1998. It started out to what will become one of the best sitcoms Fox Studios had ever released! "That 70s Show" had a lot going for it. Awesome actors that made their characters memorable, extremely funny jokes, NO EPISODE WAS BORING... they were all very hilarious, and great environments! Its hard to choose which of all the characters was the funniest, because THEY ALL WERE! Sadly to say, after Eric and Kelso left the series, the show began to lose its touch... and it ended in 2006. All and all, the show was the best of its time and I sure will miss it! If you haven't seen the series, I suggest you either watch it on FOX or FX or buy the friggin' DVDs... its a sure thing you will laugh from beginning to end! My vote is: 10/10.</div>

I still remember watching the first episode when it premiered. I did not go for it at first, but it sort of grew on me, and the obvious fact that it was a hilarious show. I could also relate to it being a guy who was born to late, but still appreciates/ prefers the past pop culture, more than whats going on today, with some exceptions. Its a bummer not to see anymore new episodes, but the last season, except for the finale was not so hot. When Ashton Kutcher, and Topher Grace left it just fell apart. But this show will live on in syndication for a long while! Thats about it except "Where was i for fun time?" - Eric Foreman</div>

It's like your actually traveling through time and chilling and playing a rock and roll record like Led Zeplon ad Alice Copper so i strongly recommend that everyone watch this show more often on Fox or UPN 13 or you could probably buy the one of season's and their currently working on season 4 now! me and my family can't wait for it so buy it it's worth it</div>

Eric Forman, Michael Kelso, Steven Hyde, Donna Pinciotti, Fez and Jackie Burkhart are great friends who often hang together in Forman's basement. Eric's Dad, Reginald "Red" Forman, hates Eric but loves his daughter, Laurie Forman, who seems to be flirty and also tries to cause problems for Eric. Kitty Forman, Eric's Mom, is religious but also a smoker. Bob Pinciotti and Midge Pinciotti are Donna's parents. Eric loves Donna and Michael Kelso loves Jackie at first but later Jackie goes with Steven Hyde. Fez is the "foreign" guy in the pack with the twisted accent. Jackie Burkhart is rich, Michael Kelso is stupid and Steven Hyde lives with Eric as Hyde's mother had left Hyde in the streets when he was kid. Altogether they form a hilarious group doing stupid stuffs and making fun of each other.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This show was probably at its creative best during the first five seasons. The dialog at that time had a welcome freshness to it and the characters were young and giving their best. The sixth season was passable at best. From the seventh season onwards, the show almost became a burden to watch as the characters aged significantly and did not really fit into the show as teenagers. The show itself progressed very slowly (plot wise) in the last six years and the growth of the actors seemed to outpace the writers.<br><br>Nevertheless, the first five seasons were filled with brilliant moments. The scripts were witty, taut and heavily embellished with pop culture of the 70's. I consider these five seasons to be the juiciest portion of the show. To those who are put off by the stupor and stale nature of the more recent episodes, I would like to remind that this show has had a much more scintillating past.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This is a really good show and I hate to see it go. I only started watching it about two years ago and I love to see how the kids lives have changed through the years. It may be a real stretch but it reminds me when I was a silly kid hanging out in a friends basement. Of course I had a girlfriend and we thought we would be together forever. I have not seen her in 35 years. It is really fun to watch these kids going through life in the 70's. It reminds me of all the trials and tribulations we had as kids. With a comic slant of course. Otherwise it wouldn't be so entertaining.My favorite is Kitty who is not the kid but Erics mom. Every time she laughs I get hysterical.Those easy and free bygone days of youth. When the most important thing in life was your girlfriend and school. This show, even if it is off the wall, brings back those memories. Here is what I would like to see in the final show. Hyde gets Donna at last since he has always loved her. Everybody finds out that Hyde is making $150,000 a year at the record store when he gives Red $25 grand for back rent and his appreciation for taking him in when he was abandoned and broke. Fez finally gets Jackie who falls madly in love with him. Red finally tells Eric that he loves him since Eric comes home from Africa. Eric came home because he won the El Gordo lottery and is filthy rich. His new girlfriend is played by Tyra Banks who is a American girl he met while she was in Africa doing charity work. Kelso has no girlfriend and no job because he got fired from his security job in Chicago. Kitty's mother tells her that she loves her and they decide to go into business together since Eric is bankrolling it. It's my idea of a good ending for a great show.</div>

Most TV shows i have seen have a new plot in each show and just try to fill it up with one liners to try get people laughing But That 70s Show has a new plot each show but also has nice long jokes and also the show has a story that goes threw a hole bunch of shows.<br><br>The cast in this show are main actor Eirc the nerdy,smart ass that treys to do the right thing. His girl friend Donna is kind of like a tom boy who would rather hang out with the boys than the girls well really theirs only one girl in the group and thats Jackie the rich snobby one of the group who is girlfriend to Kelso the good looking but often goofy one of the group. The other people in the group are Hyde hes the cool one and Fez the foreign exchange student who just wants a girl friend. Eirc friends always get Eirc in trouble so theirs Eircs loving Mom kitty and hard ass dad Red to set them straight. Eircs girlfriend Donna also has two goofy mom and dad who are always trying to keep up with all the new fads.<br><br>If i were you then i would by seasons 1 to 3 right now because you will laugh at the jokes. Get really into the show with the great story lines and the cast do such a good job entertaining and reaching real people you will think their part of your family 10 out of 10</div>

I tried to watch 5 episodes , and although I was sick that day and didn't have anything else to do, I turned it off , for the first time.Why should i write at least 10 lines for the comment if i don't have that much to say? it's the stupidest criteria that i've ever saw in the website and i'm about to give it up writing here a comments here , but i still think that they should've canceled the show after Eric went to Africa.It appears that even the circle is not funny without Eric and Kelso and that Randy guy isn't funny so they should also drop him from the water tower.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Although a little skeptical of the plot at first, I grew to really love this show and found it a staple of my daily TV at night. It wasn't intensely funny, but the characters were really likable and it made me smile thinking of the 70's again. This 8th season is an insult to anyone who was into the show.<br><br>They've made the once fun characters unlikable (changing their personalities), and are shoving Josh Meyers down our throat. <br><br>I don't know about the rest of you, but I hate that character. What happened to focus groups? Maybe the worst TV character since Oliver. The character is basically a WKRP reject who we're supposed to accept in a matter of a couple of episodes. He moves in on Donna (which anyone could have seen coming since the first episode this year) and you just get edgy as he might be the show's first unlikable personality filling a major role. <br><br>Also you've got Hyde marring an unlikable stripper character they've spent no time developing and Red dealing with it for some reason instead of kicking them out of his house. Why would you toss in this character and eliminate all the Hyde + girl story lines?<br><br>Why is Hyde living in the basement? Doesn't he own a store? <br><br>Why do they all look like they joined a gym together? <br><br>Did Bob move away? <br><br>Why would Jackie live with Fez whom she's never been able to tolerate? <br><br>This is a waste of Tommy Chong and bad way to go out. Just end this show already before it gets uglier. Just take it off the air and come back with the complete cast 1 hour final episode. They can toss "Randy" off the water tower and end up in jail like Seinfeld.<br><br>The true question is by putting the Randy character between Donna and Eric is it worse then killing off Edith as far as killing the reunion movie potential? :)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70's Show was one of my all time favorite shows I have ever seen on TV. I loved it. It has great acting, great story lines and the characters have great chemistry together. Eric (Topher Grace) is one of the main characters of the show. The whole series, up to this point he has been good friends with Donna (Laura Prepon) or her boyfriend. Their relationship has basically been the main storyline of the whole series. Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson) is sort of the outlaw of the group. He is occasionally seen in the series, trying to hook up with Jackie (Mila Kunis). Him and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) were both going after Jackie at one point. Right now the show is in it's 8th and last season and Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left. Randy (Josh Meyers) has come in and in my opinion is not a great addition. They could have done so much more better. The show is definitely going downhill but I'm sure the writers have a few tricks up their sleeve. Don't get me wrong, the show was AMAZING up to the 8th season. But I think they could have done better in the 8th season so far. This show can either have a good beginning and a good ending, or a good beginning and a horrible ending. Only time will tell.</div>

But there's one thing that strikes me in reading comments on here, in either genre.<br><br>Those that pan a production that has proved a popular hit, often display more about themselves than that which they target for their brickbats.<br><br>Let's address a few criticisms:<br><br>It's not really accurate - Well, it IS a comedy, and the best comedy consists of magnifying quirks and oddities of human nature. And, being in my sixties, if I tell you my small town Midwest social life a decade before, was much like theirs, replete with the same sort of characters, would you believe it? It happened, with more beer and less weed.<br><br>The guys all are slavering for sex and the girls wield power by withholding sex - First, what is the underlying theme of male-female relationships throughout recorded social history? Get it? Second...not true. Check Kitty and Red. And why is Kelso such a dumb-ass.. because he has NO trouble getting any! And I really don't see Donna dangling her 'bait'And Yeah... Eric is constantly wanting, he IS late teens/early twenties, RIGHT? but note he doesn't skirt-chase? Jackie is the only one that might be accused of 'bait'dangling' but look how she treats the act... she never says ANYTHING about it. Because it's inconsequential to her, totally fitting for her character and don't tell me you don't know someone like that!<br><br>There have even been a few who object to the Fez character as 'stereotypical' foreigner.. get a life! Notice they treat him as if he weren't?<br><br>No... this comedic plot-line is certainly as accurate in depiction as Mary Tyler Moore's show or Murphy Brown, and, IMO, much more than Drew Carey.<br><br>So I must ask what it says about those who don't think it's funny or that the plots are ridiculous.... do force yourself to watch some reality shows that depict real people without their masks, or even have someone tie you in a chair and turn on Jerry Springer. <br><br>Then tell me if this show is ridiculous.<br><br>Believe me...I WAS Eric, and I married Donna.<br><br>And I add my kudos to the other commenters who remarked on the Turners keeping their politics out of the show; it would have died an early death, otherwise.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70s Show is a show based on the life of a 17 year old teenager named Eric Foreman. The show revolves around Eric and his interaction with his friends (Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso, Danny Masterson as Steven Hyde, Wilmer Valderrama as Fez and Mila Kunis as Jackie), the girl next door who he has grown up with and has been best friends with since they were kids and they're just starting to explore the other feelings they have for each other (Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti) and his parents (Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty Foreman and Kurtwood Smith as Reginald "Red" Foreman). Aregueably the best seasons were in the first three when Eric and Donna are just starting to explore their relationship and letting it blossom, Eric and his friends are in high school and they're messing around like high schoolers do and Kitty and Red are pushing their son towards adult hood in a very unique way. That 70s Show is the modern day Happy Days and lots of fun for the whole family.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This is one of the best shows on TV in my opinion. There's a character for everyone. There's the nerdy Star Wars kid, the hot girl next door, the hippie anti-government guy, the moronic pretty boy, the rich snob, and the horny foreigner. We've also got the overbearing dad, the smothering mother, the hot mother next door, and her freakishly bad-tasted husband, and of course, the occasional showing of the old hippie. The way the teens try to deal with life as a whole, and slip past Red's constant 'Dumbasses', is sure to make you laugh. Serious subjects like marriage, sex, and pregnancy, become satire in this show. Even the serious moments, while few, are quickly lightened with a joke to make us laugh. If you haven't watch this show, you're missing out on a great sitcom.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">"That '70s Show" is definitely the funniest show currently on TV. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it I could tell it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an awesome character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's hilarious. It's classic when Fez goes "you son of a bitch!", and when Kelso yells "burn!", that always makes me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out being really good looking but damn, somewhere around season 5-6 she just got Really hot. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and there still hilarious. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as I did the first time I saw it. The cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this show end next year, but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever.</div>

One person earlier commented on how the famous ashton kutcher ruined his career by doing this show. Well i would just like to say that his status as a pop culture icon is because of this show. If it were not for that 70's show, nobody would know who ashton kutcher is. Anyways, this show is fabulous, and the new episodes continue to entertain me as well. This show is meant to appeal to those of the younger age group, especially teenagers, so its not meant to entirely portray the 70's perfectly and exact to the way it was. The show has to be more modern for any kids to enjoy it. I find this show humorous and entertaining, and is great to sit down and watch with a group of friends.</div>

It is sad that Aston Kutchner and Topper Grace are leaving after this season. You both should wait at least 2 more years, then jump into movies/development. You want to be in that same league as married with children. Anyone who watches this show after having a bad day, will just change their mood immediately. This cast is very talented and powerful.</div>

It also goes to show you that guest stars like Jack Osbourne, Jessica Simpson, Shannon Elizabeth and Estella Warren make this a great show to get into! I also like it when KELSO does this great BURN on Eric and Red always tells his kids that they are such DUMBASSES!! This is a great show that will always live on forever! I also liked the fact that Donna and Eric get engaged and also since this upcoming season for the show (2004-05) would be the last season. At least give a big bang to close out the series! I really like this show as much as Kelso and Eric! So For that I give it a total of<br><br>Score 10/10! PERFECTO!</div>

It's good, it is funny, the people are pretty much believable and of course, Donna (Laurie Prepon) is beyond gorgeous. Jackie (Mila Kunis) is supposed to be the pretty one, but she's chopped liver next to Donna.<br><br>"That 70's Show" works for all the reason that "That 80's Show" failed. On "That 80's Show", they took all the 80's stereotypes, grossly exaggerated them, and thrust them all together. As gross exaggerations, they weren't believable, and in any case, they wouldn't be hanging out together.<br><br>By contrast, the cast of "That 70's Show" are fairly believable, and it is easy to imagine these people hanging out together. Go to any school, and you will be able to find people there that match up well with the characters.</div>

I hope I never have to watch a finale, FINALE, because some part of me will be missing. Hint: Hyde will ditch Jackie in my season finale wish. One more thing. People just don't make shows like this as much...I give it 10 thumbs up! And any idiot that doesn't like it, will have to answer to me! GRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!! Sorry.

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I discovered "that 70s show" a few months ago and absolutely love it! I am not the target demographic for Fox sitcoms, and avoided the show initially, but on the advice of a friend tuned in.  I was pleased to discover that this show transcends the boy-centric silliness the network is known for. Topher Grace heads the cast, and he is a perfect mixture of earnest leading man and goofy comic. His timing and expressions are enough to elevate the show above standard sitcom fare.  Eric's now long standing relationship with neighbor Donna (Laura Prepon) is one of the best sitcom romances I've seen. Watching it unfold in reruns over the past few months was absolutely delightful. Laura Prepon, while not Grace's acting equal, is nonetheless a great match for him, and a refreshing face in Hollywood.  And that hair! If there are any redheads left on the planet with low self-esteem they need to watch this show. Also a standout in the cast is Danny Masterson as Hyde, a droll charmer who earns the distinction as being the most realistic looking character on TV. I think everyone went to high school with someone who looks like that guy. Ashton Kucher may get all the attention, but Hyde's the man.<br><br>I really can't get enough of this show. It's funny, nostalgic, and romantic. It has produced a previously unimaginable feeling in me... I actually feel nostalgic for my high school years.</div>

I think this is the only show I have ever seen that successfully gives me the feeling of escapism!

Filled with heart and laughs, this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and the even the drugs were tolerable. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller-skates, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "a joint was a bad place to be". Take a trip back to the greatest time in American history. Fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other. This classic is on television as much as "Full House". Don't miss it, and always remember to "Shake your groove thing!!!"</div>

I thought in the end Eric and Donna would get married but since Eric had to run out like chicken the first time they got married that never happened. Hyde and Jackie I new would never last because Jackie is a Paris Hilton in training and Hyde just isn't the kind of guy you would see on top of Paris Hilton on your people magazine. Ha ha. I actually thought that Jackie and Kelso would be a good couple because there both complete retards. Fez I think is one of those creepy dudes you see in a strip club eating candy. And all the girls are like "oh my god that guy over there is so nasty, why the hell is he eating candy well I'm over dancing around naked!" I think that this was the most under rated show on television. Overall I give this show a 9/10 because it was so damn funny!!!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">"THAT '70S SHOW," in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. I liked it when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run, especially Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). He was my favorite character. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it stays on FX for fans of the show to see for a long time.</div>

Eric goes into a coma after seeing Return of the Jedi and realizing Leia was Luke's sister and Darth Vader was Luke's father.<br><br>Donna's father moves out to Hollywood and gets a cute blonde named Heather. Whether it is Heather Thomas or Heather Locklear I don't know but since he is inexplicably lucky with women, he may get both. Plus, he finally gets rid of that perm.<br><br>Kelso marries Jackie's mom, in a little ode to real life.<br><br>Fez becomes the dictator of his country and Jackie finally marries him. After being ousted from power, Jackie returns to the US and opens shoe stores with Imelda Marcos.<br><br>Hyde finally gets clean and sober but goes broke after his record store goes out of business because he doesn't sell CDs.<br><br>All these characters end up living with Red and Kitty. Since Kitty hosts AA meetings at the house now, all of them realize they can't stand each other when they are completely sober.<br><br>Tommy Chong's character meets a guy named Cheech and start a comedy act.<br><br>As for that guy who was on the last season of the show, nobody cares about him anyway.</div>

To be honest, I don't care any more for the new episodes...I just keep watching the old ones...is there any possibility you can get those two back to the show? Really, is not the same at all!! There are many good actors, Red, Kitty, Donna, Fez....but still, it is not the same, the show lost its magic...I don't know what other people think, but I guess without Eric and Kelso, the show is almost done. And it is a real pity, because is a very good show. And that new guy...I don't even remember his name. Please, people....two stars are gone and you put this person? no offense, but that was not a good decision at all. I think the team was so good, and now is definitely incomplete. Please, take them back. At least as guest actors, one more time. Give us that favor at least one more time, to see all the team together. Thanks for reading and keep smiling! :)</div>

He comes home from band rehearsals (he plays bass) and asks if I'm going to check out this show about the 1970s. I shrug and say "okay" because I grew up back then.<br><br>Anyway, we turn it on and there is something all too familiar about the theme song and the kids cruising in the station wagon. By the end of the half hour, we are both hooked.<br><br>For the next 5 years, no matter what time or day it was on, we watched and long after he moved out in 2001, we still would reference the show at family get-togethers.<br><br>Simply put, T7S transcended all the conventional age boundaries and had something for everyone: for those of us who were teens in the mid and late 70s, it was a fun look back at some really good (and not so good) times in our lives.<br><br>For teens today, it was not all that different: A simple portrayal at the most mixed up, messed up, fun, not so fun, sad, and happy period in all of our lives--adolescence.<br><br>The last episode of the show Star Trek: The Next Generation was aptly titled "All Good Things..." and was a twist on the old saying "All Good Things Must End." T7S is no exception. It probably stayed around one or two seasons past its prime, and we ended up getting comfortable with it. Like family, you knew you could find them at some point during the week and find comfort in their presence. But on May 18, 2006, that family will be moving on.<br><br>We'll all be left with differing feelings, but I will always look back fondly and thank the cast and crew for letting me hang out in the basement each week, ride in the Vista Cruiser, hang with the kids at The Hub, check out Leo and Hyde at FotoHut, and drink beer at the water tower, and most of all, be part of the sacred circle.<br><br>I am listening to the song "Thank You" by Led Zeppelin as I type this with a big smile on my face...<br><br>"All Good Things..."</div>

I really felt i was connected ...sadly and happily...maybe,through the Sony entertainment television...i felt love after all, so, i want to confess that i wish i could meet each actor and the persons whom did "That 70's show possible.

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I have recently discovered this show and grown quickly to absolutely love it.<br><br>It's a great show because it has great characters, great writing and great performances that bring both off the page. This ensemble works so well together and is clearly written for --nearly perfectly.<br><br>I think what's enjoyable about the show is that we all know how each actor will probably react to a given situation and time and time again, they deliver and give us more than we expect, even while being believable.<br><br>I've had several favorite characters while watching this show, mainly Red, and then later Kitty. Even Eric is quite good as the straight man and I'm very impressed with how he can convey embarrassment, humiliation, realization of stupidity without saying a word. Probably the best episode for this was "Happy Jack" where he is caught masturbating at Donna's house (in the bathroom). The rest of the episode is pretty much Donna telling everyone and everyone humiliating him hilariously by making that event the topic of conversation whenever he comes into the room. Eric should've gotten an emmy based on the convincing performance of "being mortified". The scenes with Eric and his parents are priceless and I should mention that the parents attitudes are probably not that far off from real 1970's Midwestern parents. Red's attitude towards masturbation is summed up in his absolute disgust. Kitty's is hilarious as she worries aloud that Eric could become like people that are addicted to the habit and "cannot even hold down a job!" And Eric just sits there and takes it. He lives every kid's nightmare and makes you feel it too.<br><br>Even Kelso, who at first annoyed me, impresses me as he plays the Police Academy cadet, who is growing up and trying to make some responsible moves. Got to give Kutcher credit for playing that role by delivering lines that say he's grown up and still conveying that he is the same goofball that he's always been. I dare say that we are all not much different than we were as kids (personality wise) and the people that we grew up with know this. This show sort of exemplifies this bit of human nature. <br><br>The other thing that makes me think that this show has "made it" and gotten respect are the frequent cameos/guest roles. The cameos fit well into the show (much as the Friends cameos/guest roles did). It's more impressive to have 70's Show cameos, because unlike Friends, they are not a Top 10 show and yet they seem to get cameos quite reliably, especially from comedic actors.<br><br>I hope these producers, writers and actors do another show and that it has same magic and fires on all cylinders just as this one has done. It has given me a lot of pleasure.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This was a quaint little show that could featuring the comedic day to day misadventures of Eric Forman and his small group of friends as they grow up in the otherwise dreary awful 'me' decade of the 1970's. I wasn't sure if I'd like this show before I watched it. But thankfully all the crappy 70's nostalgia was kept pretty much to a minimum and it thankfully allowed the characters some breathing room (this is why the polar opposite "That 80's Show" failed dismally). Sadly after 3 or 4 seasons the show became a pale parody of itself culminating in a simply unwatchable 8th season. If the show only lasted half that long it would've been fine with me. That 70's show was never anywhere close to classic in any way, shape, or form and other comedies of the '90's could and did run circles around it, but in the beginning seasons it was a fun enough time waister. By the way the best part of the show was definitely Eric's father, Red.<br><br>My Grade: C</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This is the best show I have ever seen. I was not alive in the 70s so it kind of tell me a lot of the 70s. Eric is a good man and I am sad to see him leave to do spider man 3. All the others are very good. I really like the girls in the show. They are both hot. Now saying all that this show is 70s/80s. Why do I say that. If you know the 80s are read about the 80s you will see some stuff that did not come around until the 80s. Like In "Punk Chick", Hyde pictures Chrissy standing with two guitars (Stratocasters) strapped around her. The guitars have locking tremolos indicated by the bolts on the back of the necks. The episode takes place in '77, but locking tremolos weren't invented until around '79. The Stratocasters also have the original headstock design. During '77, Fender was owned by CBS and featured the larger "CBS design" headstock. I will put 1 more up here In one episode Journey's "Any way you want it" is playing, but the song was not released until 1980. I noticed all that. Now the show may have done that on propose but who knows. The 8th season is starting soon I can't wait to see it. And yes it is going to be there last season I will buy all the DVD's. I already have the first 2. The 3 one is coming our in November 2005. I will ask for it for Christmas so that i can save me some money. Now I must say the first season was not that good. But for it being a first season and compare to all the other that try to be a good show the first season it good. The first season on the show says where it is going with the show, so people wanted to see it and find out what happen!! It is also a funny when Red got mad at the kids. That is a good Dad. And the mom it always telling him to not yell but he needs to yell. When Leo was on the show it came even better but he went to jail so the show had to write him off. I think they did a good job on it.<br><br>I am sad to see it leave and be placed by a show called til death from the looks of it is gay and will not last. I have the seasons 1-4 DVD and i going to get all the others. Now the last season was not all that good but they where missing 2 people from the show and that was a downer. Now that 70s show is gone there is nothen good on TV. Really the only two good things are the tonight show and late night on NBC also cops and fox's Sunday prime-time but not all the show some just need to go to hell.</div>

But IMO The show still has the magic and the actors seem to be real sharp. But IMO The show is start to get a bit old since the show has been in 1979 for about 2 seasons already. That '70s Show still has the spark has it was in the good old days of 1976-77 but I think with the new story lines the show can get me interested at least in another round of great episodes! I want to see at least the show last a decade before finally calling it quits. This show deserves a rating of 9.5/10 Great show at the beginning, a bit sluggish between but still lives up to it's name to this day! That '70s SHow, bet you can't watch just one!</div>

All of the seventies references and settings are really irrelevant. The reason it is good is that at it's core it has unusually well developed characters. As with any good story, substantial and true characters are critical. This series has gotten it right. Yes, some of the situations are over the top. Yes, some of the references are silly and not particularly likely to happen. But the stories and dialogue always remain rooted in truth and dare I say again...truth in CHARACTER! You could place these people in any setting or time and they would be great together. Oh and I don't want to forget to mention, it is just damn funny. Enjoy.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This funny show focuses on the life of the very down to earth teenager Eric Forman (played by Topher Grace). He hangs out in his basement with his girlfriend Donna Pinciotti (played by Laura Prepon) the girl next door. He wouldn't survive without his friends Michael Kelso (played by Ashton Kutcher) the stupid but very lovable guy, his old girlfriend Jackie Burkhart (played by Mila Kunis) the spoiled rich girl who can be bossy and maybe even caring, Her new boyfriend Steven Hyde(played by Danny Masterson) the funny guy who thinks the governments out to get him, but can be loving and caring when it comes to Jackie. Fez (Wilmer Valderamma) the new foreign exchange student from who knows where and never reveals any info about it. The house these kids hang in is owned by Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp) and Red (Kurtwood Smith) Forman. Kitty is a mom who will not let go of her son because her daughter Laurie who turned out horrible. Red acts like a jackass but deep down he is lovable. This show I give ten out of ten stars. I started watching this show and could not stop. If your looking for comedy this is the show.</div>

Actually, the core audience for this show are probably 38-50 year old losers who wasted their teenage years wearing out their 8-track players and buying dime bags, and look back on it wistfully because their lives stink now.<br><br>What will we get in 2008?  That '80s Show?  Where the pot is replaced with coke and the kids hilariously rifle through Mom's purse each Friday to get the money for a score?  Where Donna passes out from drinking Mad Dog 20/20 and gets date-raped while at a frat party with Guns n' Roses blaring?  Hey, as long as they include those preppy sweaters and Members Only jackets, I'll be one of the losers watching it.</div>

Also, it does a terrible job of portraying the 1970's. People didn't talk or act like that in the 70's. The sets are cheap and terrible.
Happy Days did a much better job with the '50's and '60's.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">I believe that Zafoid has missed the point of the show! I grew up in the 1970's, and each one of these people I can relate to, but a different ways.<br><br>Eric/Donna - That's me and my current wife. We met in 1st grade, and dated on and off through school. When we graduated, we went out separate ways. Finally a few years ago, we got married. Eric and Donna are childhood sweethearts.<br><br>Kelso - My wife and I had several Kelso's when we grew up, just like this person, and idiot.<br><br>Fez - Again, we had a another Fez.<br><br>Hyde - We had a person like him, that had a hard beginning in life, but straighten up his act.<br><br>Red - More or less, my dad Leo - Everyone knows a "pot head".<br><br>Jackie - The shallow, average looking (to me) girl, that's only worried about money.<br><br>Kitty - My mom, lays back, but will at times (very seldom) get pushy.<br><br>Midge - The local "bombshell" that's in every community..<br><br>Laurie - There were several of these tramps when I was growing up.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>The point of the show is showing the life in the 70's in a "normal" American community, not big cities like NY. However, unlike Zafoid's comment, "is the "Eric Forman" character, that if he was any more "whipped" he would have to push his manhood back inside his body". I'be never been pushed around; but if people tried, I stood up for myself.<br><br>So I think the context of the show must be put into proper context. I served in the military for the biggest part of my adult life, and been around the world (literally). This show depicts the "normal" trails and problems of teenagers in the 70's, not the hard life in cities like LA, NYC, etc.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This show scares me. I remember watching "Happy Days" back in the seventies and thinking that the characters were a bunch of goofs. Imagine my surprise twenty years later when this show comes on, and it's about US!!! It's "Happy Days" all over again, only instead of Richie and Potsie, it's me and my friends (although NOBODY had Tanya Roberts for a mom.) The show really shows the Seventies with a good amount of realism and affection. Like everyone else has said, the actors nailed their characters down. The best show to follow "The Simpsons" that Fox has ever aired, and the best new show of the season with the exception of "Sports Night."</div>

But I really doubt they'll take them through to the "college years", as Fox's last attempt at dorm humor tanked big time ("Undeclared" anyone?).<br><br>I know Mr. Chong's stoner schtick wore itself out around 1975, but I still laugh at it. It would have been worth it for "Leo" to hang with the gang a little longer.<br><br>The new story line with Eric &amp; Donna's engagement might be the beginning of the end, but even if it is, I've got a feeling this thing is going to be run in syndication until Mila Kunis starts developing lines in her face (and she's still in her teens). So those of you looking for a quick trip back to the Jimmy Carter era should be easy to satisfy until "That '90's Show" debuts. <br><br>Until they decide to end this thing of first run episodes, pull up a chair, gather 'round the spool table, and fire one up. I hear Led Zep is gonna tour again after Bonzo "dries out"!!!</div>

This bunch of average 70s teens are completely normal and what happens to them is simply realistic (most of the time ;) ), things we can relate to, and that's what makes that That 70s Show so good and addictive ;) Beats up any Buffy The Vampire Slayer or reality show like Survivor...<br><br>It's so worth watching every day!</div>

The cast is brilliant and Topher Grace is without a doubt one of the most talented and promising actors today.  It does seems strange that this show is any good because the writing is at times awful and there is not really much going on but still the show works great because of the actors and the setting.  Thats why i say, just enjoy it.</div>

There is always one character on a sitcom that I could do without, but every single character on this show is awesome! My favorites are HYDE and DONNA. Danny Masterson makes me happy. He's the tough guy that enjoys a good laugh at the other's expense, but he's really a nice guy when it counts. Laura Prepon is so cute and funny. I empathize with her character a lot. The entire cast brings something special to the show, so check it out! You can now see it Mon-Fri/5 times a week! :::does happy dance:::</div>

I haven't seen much of Midge or Laurie, lately.  Realistic to the seventies I guess the blondes leaving (That Seventies Show) is like Farrah having left (Charlie's Angels). I hate it when people leave a show!<br><br>It's too bad that they started the show as late as 1976.  I noticed the licence plate sticker successively reads 76, 77 and 78.  If the show continues much longer it will soon have to merge into (That Eighties Show). If they started earlier they could have honed in on some "groovy" times plus a longer running promise of things to come.<br><br>Anyway I occasionally watch the show.  I like the parodies.  It's in style right now.  It's fun!  It's about time that the 1970's were recognized as one of the best decades of all time.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This isn't exactly a classic show, or one I try to watch every week without fail, but it's an acceptable fun sitcom, which these days is a hard thing to find. The 70s (and 80s) was sitcom heaven, so maybe that's one of the reasons this show works with the given setting. <br><br>Unfortunately, the show started in 1976, and although it's not a very accurate depiction of 70s life on a year to year basis (just a caricature of various 70s stereotypes really), the "decade" is running out, and the fact that they've been in high school all these years is also problematic. But through the magic of television, why ruin a good thing? Even with the novelty of the goofy hair and clothes worn off, it's a good set of characters in a good setting, so I think they should keep rolling with it as long as it works. <br><br>Happy Days and the Wonder years just progressed along in real time into the 60s and 70s, respectively, and then just took on a sort of post World War II twentieth century, non-time specific but modern feel, so the original magic that made the show work was gone. M*A*S*H on the other hand had a great setting, so the show stuck with it for a decade, even though the Korean war was only three years, and it kept working (even through numerous, mostly welcome, changes in characters.)<br><br>So basically I hope the show stays in the late 70s and finishes its run with a graduation class of '79 or New Year's Eve 1979 episode. Due to the title (and the fact that "That 80s show" is now taken) it really needs to stay in the 70s, even if it's on for another three or four years (I believe they're in 1978 now, although they're probably making very few references to the exact year.) Keeping the series going after 1980, and/or "the college years," would be like "Chico and the Man" after Chico was gone, or Laverne &amp; Shirley after Shirley left. Need I say more? <br><br>I think the flashbacks to the 60s and early 70s and the 80s dream sequences they sometimes have had are great and maybe they should have more. It worked for the Dick van Dyke show!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">"That 70's Show" is far from a gem, but it's slightly above average and I do get quite a few laughs out of it.  It's not one of those shows I rush home to see, but it's fairly entertaining.  Some of the jokes are pretty lame, and typical to most movies and TV shows with a predominantly teen cast, but they often work.  Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis and Wilder Valderama (sp.) are all talented performers.  Some of them have movie careers as well.  Mila Kunis is incredibly hot and Laura Prepon is pretty, though not stunningly beautiful.  And the girls love Ashton Kutcher, so the show covers both demographics.  But it's Kurtwood Smith who really steals the show!  Kurtwood has been in a ton of movies (i.e.:  "Robocop," "Broken Arrow," "Dead Poet's Society"), but he's one of those talented actors who most people recognize when they see him, but don't really know who he is. I'm glad he gets to show off his humorous side on this show, because he is absolutely hilarious!  His brutally honest, man-to-man advice to his son (Topher) always makes me laugh hysterically.  And Debra Jo Rupp matches wits as his wife, also quite funny.  <br><br>"That 70s Show" is not the best show on TV, but it's worth watching if you have the chance.  <br><br>My score:  6 (out of 10)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">How come nobody thought of this before?<br><br>The idea of a sitcom set in a different time to ours is a much underused premise.  Only 'Blackadder' and "Red Dwarf" (both BBC productions) stand out as meritable efforts.  'That 70's Show" is a slightly different prospect though.  It is set in a time which the majority of sitcom watching audiences can remember, and as such they can realte to the characters more.<br><br>Whilst the writers ("Buffy" supremos Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali) have obviously used the 'Friends' template of sitcom creation, there efforts are vastly superior to there predecesors.  For a start there are some wonderfully innovative set pieces, most noticeably the 'Stoner's Circle' in which four characters sit in a circle around a rotating camera and give there 2 cents about the plot so far.<br><br>The most essential thing in any sitcom is a good balance of characters.  If the plot simply centers around the interactions of two characters (see 'The Marriage That Wouldn't End' - "Friends" 1998 to 2001) you have something completley unworkable and unfunny as and end product.  'That 70's Show' succeeds in avoiding this by hooking up four of the main characters up straight away, no muss, no fuss.  So in Eric and Donna along with Jackie and Kelso, you have all the romance you'll ever need and you can concentrate on making the show funny.<br><br>And here That 70's Show succeeds utterly.  The plots themselves can be likened to 'The Simpsons' in that they are events that might nearly happen but are slightly too bizzare to actually take place.  Acting wise you have the phenomenal Christopher Grace taking the Eric Forman character by the scruf of the neck and nailing it perfectly.  Ashton Kutcher takes the crown of Most Loveable Dumb Guy on TV from Matt Le Blanc with almost frightening skill.  Wilmer Valderamma, despite a slightly shaky start as Fez has now become the most laugh out loud funny character on the show.  Mila Kunis, for all her youth, is a delight to watch and Laura Prepon's Donna, another slightly shaky starter is a great foil for Eric.<br><br>The highlight performance for me though, has to be Danny Marsterson's Hyde. If you were looing for a character who took everything that the 70's was about, you couldn't pick anyone but Marsterson.  Up there with Zach Braff (Scrubs) and Ryan Reynolds (Two Guys And A Girl) as one of the best young actors in America, Marsterson plays the character of Hyde with such penache that it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing him.  A special mention must also go to the adult actors, Kurtwood Smith and Debra Rupp, who play the satire of the middle American couple almost to the letter.<br><br>So, that concludes our tour.  "That 70s Show" is one of the brightest, funniest comedies to come out of your United States in several years.  If the event of 'That 80s Show' means that it's days are now numbered then it's a crying shame.  Watch this one while you still can folks, it doesn't get much better than this.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">This show is something of a mixed bag for me. Yes, it's funny. Topher Grace and Wilmer Valderrama get most of the laughs, of course, but I love all the characters. Also, I'm glad a show finally came along to show what the 1970s were REALLY like, rather than the sanitized universe of bloodless WASPs offered up by "The Brady Bunch" and its subsequent TV specials and movies. The kids in "That '70s Show" swear, smoke pot, make out, and defy their elders - just like teenagers in any decade do. I love it!<br><br>Even so, I can't help but wonder if the show has gone downhill. I stopped watching it on a regular basis once I realized that the writers had stopped trying to satirize the Seventies and were just dressing the kids up in retro clothing and hairstyles and placing them in absurd situations. In any case, most of the characters are cartoonish stereotypes who never existed in any decade. They're all there: the gruff father, the ditzy wife, the foreign kid who gets made fun of, etc. And that Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) is such a jerk. I don't know if young men in the Seventies actually acted the way he did, but in the Nineties no girl would want to date him and he'd be lonely and bitter.<br><br>Now they're continuing the tradition with "That '80s Show." If history is any indication, they'll throw as many Reagan-era clichés against the wall as possible in the first few episodes and then revert to the standard sitcom situations like forgetting someone's birthday, etc. Then they'll expect us to laugh simply because the characters are wearing "acid-washed jeans" (whatever the hell those are) and saying bizarre things like "Gag me with a spoon." (Yeah, I'm REALLY sure that any real-life teenager in 1984 ever used that expression without irony.) I haven't seen many episodes of "Happy Days," but I can only assume that the above applied to that show as well.<br><br>I wonder if they'll continue the franchise all the way up to our own time, giving us "That '90s Show" in about five years or so. Then the young people of 2007 will be able to laugh their heads off at soul patches, reality shows, and all those candy-colored iMacs.</div>

"That 70s Show" is a surprisingly honest and funny portrayal of small-town adolescence and coming-of-age.  Definitely worth your time.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">When I first heard of this show I thought great another excuse for media and marketing weasels to try and sell us schlocky gawdawful 70's fashions by attempting to invoke manufactured sentiment.  Well maybe they are but I still find it hilarious.  Yeah it's a pretty sanitized version of the 70's but once you get beyond the props of dorky clothes (cringe), boogey vans, the music etc. it really works beyond the 70's jokes.  Even when they dip to cliche' level they use them well and uniquely.  Eric and Donna's relationship tribulations are a fairly decent portrayal, even mature compared to a lot of the crap that's on television.<br><br>Portraying the drug culture in such a humorous light unnerves me a little, but compared to what's out there today, Mary Jane doesn't seem so bad anymore.  It isn't exactly that inaccurate either.  I remember that if kids weren't doing it there were pretending to.  I remember the films shown to us in school where the average kid gets hooked and then his whole life ends up going into the toilet (did anyone else see one staring Scott Baio?), of which they did a hilarious spoof of.  Watch it with your kids I guess and fill them in on the REAL consequences of drug use.</div>

Things that have gone, and yet again come back to appeal to the new generations.  This show is just like American life in any decade, really.  You have your basic teen friends here...  You have the smart ass of the group whom has no lovelife, so is forced to just hang out continually.  Then you have your idiot hunky jock, whom loves his girlfriend, but just can't help checking out other chicks...  Then there's the popular girl, who doesn't listen to your kind of music, but you hang out with her anyway.  Then there's the shy friend, and the girl he dates whom is just the opposite.  And who could forget the foreign exchange student from... wherever the hell he's from.  It is so much like life then and now.  Say, does anyone else remember the Foto-Huts, like my parents do?</div>

It IS a goofy sit-com. The character's are probably the dumbest I've ever seen. But I guess that's why I like it!<br><br>The show is centered around a group of 6 teenagers, four guys and two girls, living in the '70s era of The Brady Bunch and Vince Lombardi. It's basically about them living their regular everyday lives and their funny ways of dealing with everyday situations. Throw in some of the guys' parents, a foreigner and love stories between them and you have this '70s show (pun intended)...<br><br>The acting was good, especially considering that the actors and actresses are first-timers. But they look like they're having fun.<br><br>The shooting was above average. The rotating camera for the "coffee table in the basement dialogue" is excellent. It's probably an idea that's decades old but it's used to good effect. And funny too.<br><br>So it's a bit like Friends.. but in high school.<br><br>I give it a 9 out of 10.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Awesome show!! That 70's show is definitely a classic. I can see this show on TV Land 10 years after they shot their final episode. This show is only 1 of 3 shows that I actually watch on network TV. the other shows would be Dawsons Creek and Smackdown!. This show has a real feel to it. No matter what time you lived in you feel you know each of the characters in your life experiences. My fav out of all the teenagers is fez. This guy steals the show. Especially when he swears in his Arabian accent "you stoopid sun ofa beeitch". My favorite character over all is Red played by Kurtwood Smith. This guy steals the show. But its no surprise to me. I always enjoyed his small parts in movies over the years. The guy is great and IM glad he has a solid acting job. This show covers all bases and doesn't always base around sex which is cool. Because their is more to life than sex. Although network TV would have you think other wise. I personally don't like the involvement of drugs in the show. Drugs aren't cool and they shouldn't be portrayed as cool. My favorite episode is the "Dine and Dash." Kelso treats his friends to food at a fancy restaurant. But forgets to mention that he didn't plan on paying for the dinner. Obviously hilarity ensues as each member tries to figure out how to get out of the restaurant. Kelso stole the show in this episode I nearly threw up during this episode from laughing so hard. Two memorable lines are (somebody saying to kelso) "this idea is STUPID" Kelso: "Stupid or hilarious" another line from Kelso was "IM creating memories here." Awesome episode which just proves that this show is a future classic.</div>

The plot-lines aren't cliche'd and keep me laughing each week. The actors are great also. Topher Grace gives an A+ performance each week as Eric Forman (not to mention he's the hottest thing I've ever seen!). The others are great too! Everyone should at least give this show a chance; it's so awesome!</div>

I've been a huge fan of the series since the first episode!!! Ok, it's the 70s and a group of guys try to survive in a rather boring town named "Point Place" in Wisconsin. Being teenagers, they seem forced to get a life after they graduate... not!!! The show is even funnier that all Mike Myers characters together... isn't that something!!! Oh, yeah, look for the amazing Fez...he's far the coolest character of the series!</div>

I can sit down and enjoy it with my teenagers(ages 18 &amp; 15) and tell them "yes, that's what we did back then" It's so nice that each show does not revolve around sex. I particularly enjoyed the episode when the kids were in their old elementary school and looked through their permanent records. The highlight was when Hyde told everyone Jackie's middle name was Beulah and the resulting Psyco attack scene in silhouette was hilarious! Who wouldn't giggle seeing Fez dressed up like batman on his first "trick or treat" night and wondering who stole his sugar daddy!</div>

I was born in '77 and still relate to the base of the jokes - drugs, music, family, etc.  Topher Grace's portrayal of Eric has to be one of the best tv characters of all time (right up there with Phil Hartman's Bill Mcneal of NewsRadio).  His facial expressions and timing is just perfect every time.<br><br>Even better, there really isn't a star on the show.  It's usually centered around the Forman house, but sometimes there aren't even any Formans there! Everyone has had there moment in the sun, even the neighbors.</div>

It might not be too accurate, but still very funny.  The first season felt like it was written for fun.  It did capture a lot of the feelings on the time (not that I would know).  The second season feels like it is more thought out.  It is still a wonderful program.  I watch it every week, but I do miss the spontaneity of the first season</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This happens to be my favorite show ever! All I do is sit back and watch, and the laughs come.  That 70's show makes it so funny to see how people acted and what went on and how kids thought. This show is so good, I recommend anyone to see.<br><br>Also when I came to this page I was happy to see that Dazed and Confused was recommended for any That 70's Show lovers, and it is true, that happens to be my favorite movie. This show and that movie go along perfect together. So... if you LOVE this show please and see Dazed and Confused...both are great!</div>

So why, then, does this show make me all misty-eyed?  I particularly love the drug innuendo.  The obvious parallels to "Happy Days" break down there--that and the fact that people nowadays dress the same as the characters, whereas back in the 70's we didn't dress anything like the characters on "Happy Days," but instead we dressed just like the people on "That 70s Show."  Does that make sense?  Wow, far out.  Maybe I should get a tape recorder so I can get all this down.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">That 70's Show is not "the same old thing we did last week", as the opening song suggests in its lyrics.  I was the same age as the teen characters of this program back in 1977, and the trials and tribulations are amazingly accurate.  Someone in their mid to late 30's out there has hit upon a very funny program, but I wonder what will happen in two or three short years...will the program have to be renamed That 80's Show?  Will Eric and Donna ever marry and become (gasp!) Yuppies?  Parallel this with HAPPY DAYS, also set in Wisconsin, and what do you know?  That 50's show became a big hit.  Even without the leather-jacketed equivalent of Fonzie, That 70's Show is going places, but hopefully not on hiatus.  There's too many of us out there who were in HS in the 70's, and we can appreciate the storyline, as I hope many of you will also.</div>

Donna is ok too, although she's in theory smart, strong, mature, but at the same time she forgives every stupid thing Eric does and says. Kind of out of character... I haven't finished it. Only 2 seasons to go but not sure if I'll make it. It's starting to annoy me.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This show is excellent. The 70's Show is a very good representation of High School in the 70's. After the 60's everyone became obsessed with themselves. This was especially true of the teenagers. Nobody was politically correct or 'buff' and the music and drugs were great. Of course many of the whinny self-absorbed teens of today may not understand it and are to busy getting in touch with their feminine side to enjoy watching people from a time when, not only didn't the guys cry and hug each other the girls didn't much either. I suppose they can always change the channel back to shows that accurately portray the teens of today like Amanda Bynes, Dawsons Creek, or some other show where everybody starts whining and crying when their girlfriend dumps them.</div>

The cast is great!  Must also state that at first I thought that Mila Kunis was the only hottie on the show, but after watching extensively, I found that Laura Prepon is just as hot, if not hotter! Watch this show for a week, and I promise you will be hooked.</div>

the female characters just suffer and don't say a word when they're clearly sexualized by every single man on the show. it was excruciatingly painful to watch coupled with the poor comedy. i gave up after 6 seasons bc i couldn't bring myself to care.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control clickable">Let me preface this by saying I love That 70's Show. I binge watched it in less than a week and it was just fantastic. I laughed at all the jokes, I got involved with the plot, but something felt missing. Then I realized: There were three characters in the entire show that I didn't absolutely hate! Those being, Red, Kitty, and Leo. And even Red, in the later seasons, starts becoming terribly written!
Let's take a look at, in my opinion, the character with the most wasted potential. And believe me, I could do this with any character except Kitty and Leo.
1. Kelso. The idea of Kelso, a dumb, good-looking kid that can't seem to get anything right and stumbles stubbornly through life is one of the funniest things a sitcom has ever come up with. However, he is ruined by the writers in the same way all the guys in the show are: They beg for sex. Let me pose to you a scenario: It's season 2, Kelso and Jackie are dating. They get into an argument about whether or not the Packers are a good football team. Kelso says they are, Jackie says they aren't. If Jackie said, "If you say the Packers are a bad football team, we'll do it." What do you think the in character thing for Kelso's character to do would be? I say he stubbornly sticks to his guns. But I just know that the writers of the show would ruin this funny character because he's a man and he loves sex.
It's quite the conundrum, really. I love the show, but hate the characters!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I just found out this show through a rerun. Can't wait to catch from one episode to the next so I ordered the DVD of the complete seasons. I first recognized Topher Grace and I'm so amazed how funny and adorable he was as a "dumbass" as Red always called him. Other characters have their own unique personalities which make it really interesting. I love Eric's facial expressions, Topher Grace was very good at it. Hard to play his character and still be funny. It's interesting to follow Eric's family, his first love and his friends. His conversations with his Dad who is always hard on him are always funny. Her Mom Kitty is the best mom in the world. His awkward approach to win Donna will take you back to your teenage years when you started to fall in love and you would wish to be one of his friends hanging out in his basement. When he was written off on season 8 it's so hard to connect. I only watched 1 episode of season 8 and can no longer stand it.</div>
